<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h4>THE TREACHERY OF KING MARK.</h4>


<p>The story of Tristram's valorous deeds, and of
the high honor in which he was held at Camelot,
in good time came to Cornwall, where it filled King
Mark's soul with revengeful fury, and stirred the
heart of La Belle Isolde to the warmest love. The
coward king, indeed, in his jealous hatred of his
nephew, set out in disguise for England, with murderous
designs against Tristram should an opportunity
occur.</p>

<p>Many things happened to him there, and he was
brought into deep disgrace, but the story of his
adventures may be passed over in brief review, lest
the reader should find it wearisome.</p>

<p>Not far had he ridden on English soil before he
met with Dinadan, who, in his jesting humor, soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
played him a merry trick. For he arrayed Dagonet,
the king's fool, in a suit of armor, which he made
Mark believe was Lancelot's. Thus prepared, Dagonet
rode to meet him and challenged him to a
joust. But King Mark, on seeing what he fancied
was Lancelot's shield, turned and fled at headlong
speed, followed by the fool and his comrades with
hunting cries and laughter till the forest rang with
the noise.</p>

<p>Escaping at length from this merry chase, the
trembling dastard made his way to Camelot, where
he hoped some chance would arise to aid him in his
murderous designs on Tristram. But a knight of
his own train, named Sir Amant, had arrived there
before him, and accused him of treason to the king,
without telling who he was.</p>

<p>"This is a charge that must be settled by wager
of battle," said King Arthur. "The quarrel is
between you; you must decide it with sword and
spear."</p>

<p>In the battle that followed, Sir Amant, by
unlucky fortune, was run through, and fell from his
horse with a mortal wound.</p>

<p>"Heaven has decided in my favor," cried King
Mark. "But here I shall no longer stay, for it
does not seem a safe harbor for honest knights."</p>

<p>He thereupon rode away, fearing that Dinadan
would reveal his name. Yet not far had he gone
before Lancelot came in furious haste after him.</p>

<span class="caption">ST. MICHAEL'S MOUNT, CORNWALL.</span>
</div>

<p>"Turn again, thou recreant king and knight,"
he loudly called. "To Arthur's court you must
return, whether it is your will or not. We know
you, villain. Sir Amant has told your name and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
purpose; and, by my faith, I am strongly moved
to kill you on the spot."</p>

<p>"Fair sir," asked King Mark, "what is your
name?"</p>

<p>"My name is Lancelot du Lake. Defend yourself,
dog and dastard."</p>

<p>On hearing this dreaded name, and seeing Lancelot
riding upon him with spear in rest, King
Mark tumbled like a sack of grain from his saddle
to the earth, crying in terror, "I yield me, Sir
Lancelot! I yield me!" and begging piteously
for mercy.</p>

<p>"Thou villain!" thundered Lancelot, "I would
give much to deal thee one buffet for the love of
Tristram and Isolde. Mount, dog, and follow me."</p>

<p>Mark hastened to obey, and was thus brought like
a slave back to Arthur's court, where he made such
prayers and promises that in the end the king
forgave him, but only on condition that he would
enter into accord with Tristram, and remove from
him the sentence of banishment. All this King
Mark volubly promised and swore to abide by,
though a false heart underlay his fair words. But
Tristram gladly accepted the proffered truce with
his old enemy, for his heart burned with desire to
see his lady love again.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Dinadan, with Dagonet and his
companions, came to court, and great was the
laughter and jesting at King Mark when they told
the story of his flight from Arthur's fool.</p>

<p>"This is all very well for you stay-at-homes,"
cried Mark; "but even a fool in Lancelot's armor
is not to be played with. As it was, Dagonet paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
for his masquerade, for he met a knight who
brought him like a log to the ground, and all these
laughing fellows with him."</p>

<p>"Who was that?" asked King Arthur.</p>

<p>"I can tell you," said Dinadan. "It was Sir
Palamides. I followed him through the forest, and
a lively time we had in company."</p>

<p>"Aha! then you have had adventures."</p>

<p>"Rare ones. We met a knight before Morgan
le Fay's castle. You know the custom there, to
let no knight pass without a hard fight for it.
This stranger made havoc with the custom, for
he overthrew ten of your sister's knights, and killed
some of them. He afterwards tilted with Palamides
for offering to help him, and gave that
doughty fellow a sore wound."</p>

<p>"Who was this mighty champion? Not Lancelot
or Tristram?" asked the king, looking around.</p>

<p>"On our faith we had no hand in it," they both
answered.</p>

<p>"It was the knight next to them in renown,"
answered Dinadan.</p>

<p>"Lamorak of Wales?"</p>

<p>"No less. And, my faith, a sturdy fellow he is.
I left him and Palamides the best of friends."</p>

<p>"I hope, then, to see the pair of them at next
week's tournament," said the king.</p>

<p>Alas for Lamorak! Better for him far had he
kept away from that tournament. His gallant
career was near its end, for treachery and hatred
were soon to seal his fate. This sorrowful story
it is now our sad duty to tell.</p>

<p>Lamorak had long loved Margause, the queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
of Orkney, Arthur's sister and the mother of Gawaine
and his brethren. For this they hated him,
and with treacherous intent invited their mother
to a castle near Camelot, as a lure to her lover.
Soon after the tournament, at which Lamorak won
the prize of valor, and redoubled the hatred of
Gawaine and his brothers by overcoming them in
the fray, word was brought to the victorious knight
that Margause was near at hand and wished to
see him.</p>

<p>With a lover's ardor, he hastened to the castle
where she was, but, as they sat in the queen's apartment
in conversation, the door was suddenly flung
open, and Gaheris, one of the murderous brethren,
burst in, full armed and with a naked sword in his
hand. Rushing in fury on the unsuspecting lovers,
with one dreadful blow he struck off his mother's
head, crimsoning Lamorak with her blood. He
next assailed Lamorak, who, being unarmed, was
forced to fly for his life, and barely escaped.</p>

<p>The tidings of this dread affair filled the land
with dismay, and many of the good knights of
Arthur's court threatened reprisal. Arthur himself
was full of wrath at the death of his sister. Yet
those were days when law ruled not, but force was
master, and retribution only came from the strong
hand and the ready sword. This was Lamorak's
quarrel, and the king, though he vowed to protect
him from his foes, declared that the good knight
of Wales must seek retribution with his own hand.</p>

<p>He gained death, alas! instead of revenge, for
his foes proved too vigilant for him, and overcame
him by vile treachery. Watching his movements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
they lay in ambush for him at a difficult place,
and as he was passing, unsuspicious of danger, they
set suddenly upon him, slew his horse, and assailed
him on foot.</p>

<p>Gawaine, Mordred, and Gaheris formed this ambush,
for the noble-minded Gareth had refused to
take part in their murderous plot; and with desperate
fury they assaulted the noble Welsh knight,
who, for three hours, defended himself against their
utmost strength. But at the last Mordred dealt
him a death-blow from behind, and when he fell
in death the three murders hewed him with their
swords till scarce a trace of the human form was
left.</p>

<p>Thus perished one of the noblest of Arthur's
knights, and thus was done one of the most villanous
deeds of blood ever known in those days of
chivalrous war.</p>

<p>Before the death of Lamorak another event happened
at Arthur's court which must here be told,
for it was marvellous in itself, and had in it the
promise of wondrous future deeds.</p>

<p>One day there came to the court at Camelot a
knight attended by a young squire. When he had
disarmed he went to the king and asked him to
give the honor of knighthood to his squire.</p>

<p>"What claim has he to it?" asked the king.
"Of what lineage is he?"</p>

<p>"He is the youngest son of King Pellinore, and
brother to Sir Lamorak. He is my brother also;
for my name is Aglavale, and I am of the same
descent."</p>

<p>"What is his name?"</p>

<p>"Percivale."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then for my love of Lamorak, and the love I
bore your father, he shall be made a knight to-morrow."</p>

<p>So when the morrow dawned, the king ordered
that the youth should be brought into the great
hall, and there he knighted him, dealing him the
accolade with his good sword Excalibur.</p>

<p>And so the day passed on till the dinner-hour,
when the king seated himself at the head of the
table, while down its sides were many knights of
prowess and renown. Percivale, the new-made
knight, was given a seat among the squires and
the untried knights, who sat at the lower end of
the great dining-table.</p>

<p>But in the midst of their dinner an event of
great strangeness occurred. For there came into
the hall one of the queen's maidens, who was of
high birth, but who had been born dumb, and in
all her life had spoken no word. Straight across
the hall she walked, while all gazed at her in mute
surprise, till she came to where Percivale sat.
Then she took him by the hand, and spoke in a
voice that rang through the hall with the clearness
of a trumpet,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arise, Sir Percivale, thou noble knight and
warrior of God's own choosing. Arise and come
with me."</p>

<p>He rose in deep surprise, while all the others
sat in dumb wonder at this miracle. To the Round
Table she led him, and to the right side of the seat
perilous, in which no knight had hitherto dared
to sit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>"Fair knight, take here your seat;" she said.
"This seat belongs to you, and to none other, and
shall be yours until a greater than you shall come."</p>

<p>This said, she departed and asked for a priest.
Then was she confessed and given the sacrament,
and forthwith died. But the king and all his court
gazed with wonder on Sir Percivale, and asked
themselves what all this meant, and for what great
career God had picked out this youthful knight,
for such a miracle no man there had ever seen
before.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, King Mark had gone back to Cornwall,
and with him went Sir Tristram, at King
Arthur's request, though not till Arthur had made
the Cornish king swear on Holy Scripture to do
his guest no harm, but hold him in honor and
esteem.</p>

<p>Lancelot, however, was full of dread and anger
when he heard what had occurred, and he told
King Mark plainly that if he did mischief to Sir
Tristram he would slay him with his own hands.</p>

<p>"Bear this well in mind, sir king," he said,
"for I have a way of keeping my word."</p>

<p>"I have sworn before King Arthur to treat him
honorably," answered Mark. "I, too, have a way
of keeping my word."</p>

<p>"A way, I doubt not," said Lancelot, scornfully;
"but not my way. Your reputation for truth needs
mending. And all men know for what you came
into this country. Therefore, take heed what you
do."</p>

<p>Then Mark and Tristram departed, and soon
after they reached Cornwall a damsel was sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
to Camelot with news of their safe arrival, and
bearing letters from Tristram to Arthur and Lancelot.
These they answered and sent the damsel
back, the burden of Lancelot's letter being, "Beware
of King Fox, for his ways are ways of wiles."</p>

<p>They also sent letters to King Mark, threatening
him if he should do aught to Tristram's injury.
These letters worked harm only, for they roused
the evil spirit in the Cornish king's soul, stirring
him up to anger and thirst for revenge. He
thereupon wrote to Arthur, bidding him to meddle
with his own concerns, and to take heed to his wife
and his knights, which would give him work enough
to do. As for Sir Tristram, he said that he held
him to be his mortal enemy.</p>

<p>He wrote also to Queen Guenever, his letter being
full of shameful charges of illicit relations with
Sir Lancelot, and dishonor to her lord, the king.
Full of wrath at these vile charges, Guenever took
the letter to Lancelot, who was half beside himself
with anger on reading it.</p>

<p>"You cannot get at him to make him eat his
words," said Dinadan, whom Lancelot took into
his confidence. "And if you seek to bring him to
terms with pen and ink, you will find that his villany
will get the better of your honesty. Yet there
are other ways of dealing with cowardly curs.
Leave him to me; I will make him wince. I will
write a mocking lay of King Mark and his doings,
and will send a harper to sing it before him at his
court. When this noble king has heard my song I
fancy he will admit that there are other ways of
gaining revenge besides writing scurrilous letters."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>A stinging lay, indeed, was that which Dinadan
composed. When done he taught it to a harper
named Eliot, who in his turn taught it to other
harpers, and these, by the orders of Arthur and
Lancelot, went into Wales and Cornwall to sing
it everywhere.</p>

<p>Meanwhile King Mark's crown had been in great
danger. For his country had been invaded by an
army from Session, led by a noted warrior named
Elias, who drove the forces of Cornwall from the
field and besieged the king in his castle of Tintagil.
And now Tristram came nobly to the rescue. At
the head of the Cornish forces he drove back the
besiegers with heavy loss, and challenged Elias to
a single combat to end the war. The challenge was
accepted, and a long and furious combat followed,
but in the end Elias was slain, and the remnant
of his army forced to surrender.</p>

<p>This great service added to the seeming accord
between Tristram and the king, but in his heart
Mark nursed all his old bitterness, and hated him
the more that he had helped him. His secret fury
soon found occasion to flame to the surface. For at
the feast which was given in honor of the victory,
Eliot, the harper, appeared, and sang before the
king and his lords the lay that Dinadan had made.</p>

<p>This was so full of ridicule and scorn of King
Mark that he leaped from his seat in a fury of
wrath before the harper had half finished.</p>

<p>"Thou villanous twanger of strings!" he cried.
"What hound sent you into this land to insult me
with your scurrilous songs?"</p>

<p>"I am a minstrel," said Eliot, "and must obey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the orders of my lord. Sir Dinadan made this
song, if you would know, and bade me sing it here."</p>

<p>"That jesting fool!" cried Mark, in wrath.
"As for you, fellow, you shall go free through
minstrels' license. But if you lose any time in
getting out of this country you may find that Cornish
air is not good for you."</p>

<p>The harper took this advice and hastened away,
bearing letters from Tristram to Lancelot and
Dinadan. But King Mark turned the weight of
his anger against Tristram, whom he believed had
instigated this insult, with the design to set all the
nobles of his own court laughing at him. And
well he knew that the villanous lay would be sung
throughout the land, and that he would be made
the jest of all the kingdom.</p>

<p>"They have their sport now," he said. "Mine
will come. Tristram of Lyonesse shall pay dearly
for this insult. And all that hold with him shall
learn that King Mark of Cornwall is no child's
bauble to be played with."</p>

<p>The evil-minded king was not long in putting
his project in execution. At a tournament which
was held soon afterwards Tristram was badly
wounded, and King Mark, with great show of
sorrow, had him borne to a castle near by, where
he took him under his own care as nurse and leech.</p>

<p>Here he gave him a sleeping draught, and had
him borne while slumbering to another castle, where
he was placed in a strong prison cell, under the
charge of stern keepers.</p>

<p>The disappearance of Tristram made a great stir
in the kingdom. La Belle Isolde, fearing treachery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
went to a faithful knight named Sir Sadok, and
begged him to try and discover what had become
of the missing knight. Sadok set himself diligently
to work; and soon learned that Tristram was held
captive in the castle of Lyonesse. Then he went
to Dinas, the seneschal, and others, and told them
what had been done, at which they broke into open
rebellion against King Mark, and took possession
of all the towns and castles in the country of Lyonesse,
filling them with their followers.</p>

<p>But while the rebellious army was preparing to
march on Tintagil, and force King Mark to set
free his prisoner, Tristram was delivered by the
young knight Sir Percivale, who had come thither
in search of adventures, and had heard of King
Mark's base deed. Great was the joy between these
noble knights, and Tristram said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you abide in these marches, Sir Percivale?
If so, I will keep you company."</p>

<p>"Nay, dear friend, I cannot tarry here. Duty
calls me into Wales."</p>

<p>But before leaving Cornwall he went to King
Mark, told him what he had done, and threatened
him with the revenge of all honorable knights if
he sought again to injure his noble nephew.</p>

<p>"What would you have me do?" asked the king.
"Shall I harbor a man who openly makes love to
my wife and queen?"</p>

<p>"Is there any shame in a nephew showing an
open affection for his uncle's wife?" asked Percivale.
"No man will dare say that so noble a warrior
as Sir Tristram would go beyond the borders
of sinless love, or will dare accuse the virtuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
lady La Belle Isolde of lack of chastity. You have
let jealousy run away with your wisdom, King
Mark."</p>

<p>So saying, he departed; but his words had little
effect on King Mark's mind. No sooner had Percivale
gone than he began new devices to gratify his
hatred of his nephew. He sent word to Dinas, the
seneschal, under oath, that he intended to go to the
Pope and join the war against the infidel Saracens,
which he looked upon as a nobler service than that
of raising the people against their lawful king.</p>

<p>So earnest were his professions that Dinas believed
him and dismissed his forces, but no sooner
was this done than King Mark set aside his oath
and had Tristram again privately seized and
imprisoned.</p>

<p>This new outrage filled the whole realm with
tumult and rebellious feeling. La Belle Isolde was
at first thrown into the deepest grief, and then her
heart swelled high with resolution to live no longer
with the dastard who called her wife. Tristram
at the same time privately sent her a letter, advising
her to leave the court of her villanous lord, and
offering to go with her to Arthur's realm, if she
would have a vessel privately made ready.</p>

<p>The queen thereupon had an interview with Dinas
and Sadok, and begged them to seize and imprison
the king, since she was resolved to escape from his
power.</p>

<p>Furious at the fox-like treachery of the king,
these knights did as requested, for they formed a
plot by which Mark was privately seized, and they
imprisoned him secretly in a strong dungeon. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the same time Tristram was delivered, and soon
sailed openly away from Cornwall with La Belle
Isolde, gladly shaking the dust of that realm of
treachery from his feet.</p>

<p>In due time the vessel touched shore in King
Arthur's dominions, and gladly throbbed the heart
of the long-unhappy queen as her feet touched
that free and friendly soil. As for Tristram, never
was lover fuller of joy, and life seemed to him to
have just begun.</p>

<p>Not long had they landed when a knightly chance
brought Lancelot into their company. Warm indeed
was the greeting of those two noble companions,
and glad the welcome which Lancelot gave
Isolde to English soil.</p>

<p>"You have done well," he said, "to fly from that
wolf's den. There is no noble knight in the world
but hates King Mark and will honor you for leaving
his palace of vile devices. Come with me, you shall
be housed at my expense."</p>

<p>Then he rode with them to his own castle of
Joyous Gard, a noble stronghold which he had won
with his own hands. A royal castle it was, garnished
and provided with a richness which no king
or queen could surpass. Here Lancelot bade them
use everything as their own, and charged all his
people to love and honor them as they would himself.</p>

<p>"Joyous Gard is yours as long as you will honor
it by making it your home," he said. "As for me,
I can have no greater joy than to know that my
castle is so nobly tenanted, and that Tristram of
Lyonesse and Queen Isolde are my honored guests."</p>

<p>Leaving them, Lancelot rode to Camelot, where
he told Arthur and Guenever of what had happened,
much to their joy and delight.</p>

<p>"By my crown," cried Arthur, joyfully, "the
coming of Tristram and Isolde to my realm is no
everyday event, and is worthy of the highest honor.
We must signalize it with a noble tournament."</p>

<p>Then he gave orders that a stately passage-at-arms
should be held on May-day at the castle of
Lonazep, which was near Joyous Gard. And word
was sent far and near that the knights of his own
realm of Logris, with those of Cornwall and North
Wales, would be pitted against those of the rest of
England, of Ireland and Scotland, and of lands
beyond the seas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h4>HOW TRISTRAM BEFOOLED DINADAN.</h4>


<p>Never were two happier lovers than Tristram
and Isolde at Joyous Gard. Their days were spent
in feasting and merriment, Isolde's heart overflowing
with joy to be free from the jealousy of her ill-tempered
spouse, and Tristram's to have his lady
love to himself, far from treacherous plots and
murderous devices.</p>

<p>Every day Tristram went hunting, for at that
time men say he was the best courser at the chase
in the world, and the rarest blower of the horn
among all lovers of sport. From him, it is said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
came all the terms of hunting and hawking, the
distinction between beasts of the chase and vermin,
all methods of dealing with hounds and with
game, and all the blasts of the chase and the recall,
so that they who delight in huntsmen's sport will
have cause to the world's end to love Sir Tristram
and pray for his soul's repose.</p>

<p>Yet Isolde at length grew anxious for his welfare,
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I marvel that you ride so much to the chase
unarmed. This is a country not well known to
you, and one that contains many false knights,
while King Mark may lay some plot for your
destruction. I pray you, my dear love, to take more
heed to your safety."</p>

<p>This advice seemed timely, and thereafter Tristram
rode in armor to the chase, and followed by
men who bore his shield and spear. One day, a
little before the month of May, he followed a hart
eagerly, but as the animal led him by a cool woodland
spring, he alighted to quench his thirst in the
gurgling waters.</p>

<p>Here, by chance, he met with Dinadan, who had
come into that country in search of him. Some
words of greeting passed between them, after which
Dinadan asked him his name, telling his own. This
confidence Tristram declined to return, whereupon
Dinadan burst out in anger.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Marriage_Pg_24" id="Marriage_Pg_24"></a><img src="images/p24.jpg" width="500" height="295" alt="MARRIAGE OF SIR TRISTRAM." title="MARRIAGE OF SIR TRISTRAM." />
<span class="caption">MARRIAGE OF SIR TRISTRAM.</span>
</div>

<p>"You value your name highly, sir knight," he
said. "Do you design to ride everywhere under
a mask? Such a foolish knight as you I saw but
lately lying by a well. He seemed like one asleep,
and no word could be got from him, yet all the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
he grinned like a fool. The fellow was either an
idiot or a lover, I know not which."</p>

<p>"And are not you a lover?" asked Tristram.</p>

<p>"Marry, my wit has saved me from that craft."</p>

<p>"That is not well said," answered Tristram.
"A knight who disdains love is but half a man,
and not half a warrior."</p>

<p>"I am ready to stand by my creed," retorted
Dinadan. "As for you, sirrah, you shall tell me
your name, or do battle with me."</p>

<p>"You will not get my name by a threat, I
promise you that," said Tristram. "I shall not
fight till I am in the mood; and when I do, you
may get more than you bargain for."</p>

<p>"I fear you not, coward," said Dinadan.</p>

<p>"If you are so full of valor, here is your man,"
said Tristram, pointing to a knight who rode along
the forest aisle towards them. "He looks ready
for a joust."</p>

<p>"On my life, it is the same dull-plate knave I
saw lying by the well, neither sleeping nor waking,"
said Dinadan.</p>

<p>"This is not the first time I have seen that covered
shield of azure," said Tristram. "This knight
is Sir Epinegris, the son of the king of Northumberland,
than whom the land holds no more
ardent lover, for his heart is gone utterly out to the
fair daughter of the king of Wales. Now, if you
care to find whether a lover or a non-lover is the
better knight, here is your opportunity."</p>

<p>"I shall teach him to grin to more purpose,"
said Dinadan. "Stand by and you shall see."</p>

<p>Then, as the lover approached, he cried,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>"Halt, sir knight, and make ready to joust, as
is the custom with errant knights."</p>

<p>"Let it be so, if you will," answered Epinegris.
"Since it is the custom of you knight-errant to
make a man joust whether he will or no, I am your
man."</p>

<p>"Make ready, then, for here is for you."</p>

<p>Then they spurred their horses and rode together
at full speed, Dinadan breaking his spear,
while Epinegris struck him so shrewd a blow that
he rolled upon the earth.</p>

<p>"How now?" cried Tristram. "It seems to
me that the lover has best sped."</p>

<p>"Will you play the coward?" queried Dinadan.
"Or will you, like a good knight, revenge me?"</p>

<p>"I am not in the mood," answered Tristram.
"Take your horse, Sir Dinadan, and let us get
away from here, where hard blows are more plentiful
than soft beds."</p>

<p>"Defend me from such fellowship as yours!"
roared Dinadan. "Take your way and I will take
mine. We fit not well together."</p>

<p>"I might give you news of Sir Tristram."</p>

<p>"Sir Tristram, if he be wise, will seek better
company. I can do without your news, as I have
had to do without your help," and he rode on in
high dudgeon.</p>

<p>"Farewell, then," cried Tristram, laughing. "It
may happen we shall soon meet again."</p>

<p>Tristram rode back in much amusement to Joyous
Gard, but on coming near he heard in the neighboring
town a great outcry.</p>

<p>"What means this noise?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>"Sir," he was told, "a knight of the castle has
just been slain by two strangers, and for no other
cause than saying that Sir Lancelot was a better
knight than Sir Gawaine."</p>

<p>"Who would dispute that?" said Tristram. "It
is a small cause for the death of a good man, that
he stands for his lord's fame."</p>

<p>"But what remedy have we?" said the towns-men.
"If Lancelot had been here, these fellows
would soon have been called to a reckoning. But,
alas, he is away."</p>

<p>"I may do something in his service," answered
Tristram. "If I take his place, I must defend his
followers."</p>

<p>Thereupon he sent for his shield and spear, and
rode in pursuit of the two knights, whom he overtook
before they had gone far.</p>

<p>"Turn, sir dastards," he cried, "and amend your
misdeeds."</p>

<p>"What amends wish you?" asked one of the
knights. "We are ready with spear and sword to
make good whatever we have done."</p>

<p>He rode against Tristram, but was met so sturdily
in mid career that he was thrust over his horse's
tail. Then the other rode against him, and was
served in the same rough manner.</p>

<p>They rose as quickly as they could, drew their
swords, and challenged him to battle on foot.</p>

<p>"You shall tell me your names," he said, sternly.
"I warn you that if it comes to sword-play you
will find more than your match. Yet you may
have that in your lineage which will keep you from
my hands, however much you deserve punishment
for your evil deeds."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>"As for our names, we dread not to tell them.
We are Agravaine and Gaheris, brothers to the good
knight Gawaine, and nephews of King Arthur."</p>

<p>"For Arthur's sake, then, I must let you pass
unscathed. Yet it is a crying shame that men of
such good blood as you should play the part of
murderers. You slew among you a better knight
than the best of your kin, Lamorak de Galis, and
I would to God I had been by at that time."</p>

<p>"You would have gone the same road," said
Gaheris.</p>

<p>"Not without more knights to do it than you
had in your murderous crew."</p>

<p>With these words he turned from them and rode
back towards Joyous Gard. When he had gone they
regained their horses, and feeling themselves safe
in the saddle their courage returned.</p>

<p>"Let us pursue this boaster," they said, "and
see if he fares so much better than Lamorak."</p>

<p>They did so, and when they came near Tristram,
who was jogging slowly along, Agravaine cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Turn, traitor knight!"</p>

<p>"Traitor in your teeth!" cried Tristram, in a
rage. "I let you off too cheaply, it seems." And
drawing his sword, he turned upon Agravaine and
smote him so fiercely on the helm that he fell
swooning from his horse, with a dangerous wound.</p>

<p>Then he turned to Gaheris and dealt him a blow
that in like manner tumbled him from his saddle
to the earth. This done, Tristram turned and rode
into the castle, leaving them like dead men in the
road.</p>

<p>Here he told La Belle Isolde of his several adventures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
When he spoke of Dinadan, she asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Was it not he that made the song about King
Mark?"</p>

<p>"The same," answered Tristram. "He is the
greatest jester at Arthur's court, but a good knight
withal, and I know no man whom I like better as
a comrade."</p>

<p>"Why did you not bring him with you?"</p>

<p>"No need of that. He is seeking me through
this country, and there is no fear that he will give
up the search lightly."</p>

<p>As they spoke, a servant came and told Tristram
that a knight-errant had entered the town, and
described the device on his shield.</p>

<p>"That is our man now," said Tristram. "That
is Dinadan. Send for him, Isolde, and you shall
hear the merriest knight and the maddest talker
that you ever spoke with. I pray you to make
him heartily welcome, for he is a cherished friend
of mine."</p>

<p>Then Isolde sent into the town with a message
to Dinadan, begging that he would come to the
castle and rest a while there, at a lady's wish.</p>

<p>"That will I, with a good will," answered Dinadan.
"I were but a churl else."</p>

<p>He hastened to mount and ride to the castle,
and here he was shown to a chamber where he laid
aside his armor. Then he was brought into the
presence of La Belle Isolde, who courteously bade
him welcome.</p>

<p>"Whence, come you, and what name do you
bear?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Madam," he answered, "I am from King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Arthur's court, and am one of the small fry of
Round Table Knights. My name is Dinadan."</p>

<p>"And why came you hither?"</p>

<p>"I am seeking my old friend and comrade, Sir
Tristram, who I am told has made his way to this
country."</p>

<p>"That I cannot answer for," said Isolde. "He
may and he may not be here. Sir Tristram will
be found where love leads him."</p>

<p>"I warrant me that. Your true lover has no
will of his own, but is led like an ox, with a ring
in his nose. I marvel what juice of folly gets
into the pates of these lovers to make them so mad
about the women."</p>

<p>"Why, sir," said Isolde, "can it be that you are
a knight and no lover? I fancy that there can
be no true man-of-arms who seeks not by his deeds
to win the smiles of the fair."</p>

<p>"They who care to be fed on smiles are welcome
to them, but I am not made of that fashion," answered
Dinadan. "The joy of love is too short,
and the sorrow thereof too long, to please my
fancy."</p>

<p>"Say you so? Yet near here but to-day was the
good knight Sir Bleoberis, he who fought with three
knights at once for a maiden's sake, and won her
before the king of Northumberland."</p>

<p>"I know him for a worthy fellow," said Dinadan,
"as are all of Lancelot's kindred. Yet he has
crotchets in his head, like all that crew."</p>

<p>"Now, I pray you," said Isolde, "will you not
do me the grace to fight for my love with three
knights that have done me great wrong? As you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
are a knight of King Arthur's, you can never say
me nay in such a duty."</p>

<p>"Can I not?" cried Dinadan. "This much I
will say, madam, that you are as fair a sample of
womankind as ever I saw, and much more beautiful
than is my lady Queen Guenever. And yet, heaven
defend me, I will not fight for you against three
knights; and would not, were you Helen of Troy
herself."</p>

<p>At these words, and the odd grimace which he
made, La Belle Isolde burst into a merry peal of
laughter, and broke out with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know you better than you fancy, Sir Dinadan.
And well you keep up your credit of being a
merry fellow. You are very welcome to my castle,
good sir."</p>

<p>They had much more of gameful conversation
together, and Dinadan was treated with all honor,
and slept serenely at the castle that night. But
Tristram took good care to keep out of his sight.</p>

<p>Early the next day Tristram armed himself and
prepared to ride away, saying to the Lady Isolde
that he would contrive to meet with Dinadan, and
would ride with him to Lonazep, where the tournament
was to be held. He promised also to make
arrangements to provide her with a good place from
which to see the passage-at-arms. Then he departed,
accompanied by two squires, who bore his
shield and a brace of great and long spears.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Dinadan left the castle, bidding
a merry adieu to the lady, and rode so briskly
forward that he soon overtook Tristram. He knew
him at sight for his yesterday's comrade, and made
a sour grimace at beholding him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>"So," he said, "here again is my easy-going
friend, who wears his armor for a holiday parade.
You shall not get off so lightly to-day, fellow.
You shall joust with me, despite your head."</p>

<p>"Faith, I am not eager," said Tristram, "but a
wilful man will have his way; so let us have it
over, if fight we must."</p>

<p>Then they rode at each other, and Dinadan broke
a spear on Tristram's shield, but Tristram purposely
missed him.</p>

<p>Dinadan now bade him draw his sword.</p>

<p>"Not I," he answered. "What makes you so
warlike? I am not in the humor to fight."</p>

<p>"You shame all knights by your cowardice."</p>

<p>"So far as that goes, it troubles me little," said
Tristram. "Suppose, my good sir, you take me
under your protection. Though I bear arms I shall
gladly accept the patronage of so worthy a knight
as you."</p>

<p>"The devil deliver me of you!" cried Dinadan.
"You are a fellow of goodly build, and sit your
horse like a warrior; but heaven knows if you have
blood or water in your veins. What do you propose
to do with those great spears that your squire
carries?"</p>

<p>"I shall give them to some good knight at the
tournament. If you prove the best there, you are
welcome to them."</p>

<p>As they thus conversed they saw a knight-errant
in the road before them, who sat with spear in rest
as if eager to joust.</p>

<p>"Come," said Tristram, "since you are so
anxious for a fight, yonder is your man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>"Shame betide you for a dastard," cried Dinadan.
"Fight him yourself. You can't get more
than a fall."</p>

<p>"Not so. That knight seems a shrewish fellow.
It will need a stronger hand than mine to manage
him."</p>

<p>"Good faith, then, here's to teach you a lesson,"
said Dinadan, and he rode fiercely against the other
knight, with the unlucky result that he was thrust
from his horse, and fell headlong to the earth.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?" said Tristram. "You
had better have taken a lesson from my prudence,
and let that good fellow alone."</p>

<p>"The fiends take you, coward!" cried Dinadan,
as he started to his feet and drew his sword.
"Come, sir knight, you are my better on horseback,
let us have it out on foot."</p>

<p>"Shall it be in love or in anger?" said the other.</p>

<p>"Let it be in love. I am saving all my anger
for this do-nothing who came with me."</p>

<p>"Then I pray you to tell me your name."</p>

<p>"Folks call me Dinadan."</p>

<p>"Ah, and I am your comrade Gareth. I will
not fight with an old friend like Dinadan."</p>

<p>"Nor I with you, by my faith!" cried Dinadan,
seizing Gareth's hand and giving it a warm pressure.
"Beaumains is safe from my spear. Here
is a chap now, if you want to try your skill; but
if you can get him to fight you must first learn the
art of converting a coward into a man of valor."</p>

<p>Tristram laughed quietly at this, and bided his
time. Nor was there long to wait, for just then a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
well-armed knight rode up, on a sturdy horse, and
put his spear in rest as he approached.</p>

<p>"Now, my good sirs," said Tristram, "choose
between yourselves which will joust with yonder
knight; for I warn you that I will keep clear of
him."</p>

<p>"Faith, you had better," said Gareth. "Leave
him to me."</p>

<p>And he rode against the knight but with such
ill-fortune that he was thrust over his horse's croup.</p>

<p>"It is your turn now," said Tristram to Dinadan.
"Honor requires that you should avenge your comrade
Gareth."</p>

<p>"Honor does, eh? Then reason does not, and
I always weigh reason against honor. He has overturned
a much bigger fellow than I, and with your
kind permission I will not stir up that hornet."</p>

<p>"Aha, friend Dinadan, your heart fails you after
all your boasting. Very well, you shall see what
the coward can do. Make ready, sir knight."</p>

<p>Then Tristram rode against the victorious knight,
and dealt him so shrewd a buffet that he was thrust
from his horse.</p>

<p>Dinadan looked at this in amazement. Was this
the fellow that professed cowardice and begged protection?
"The cunning rogue," he said to himself,
"has been making game of me. The rascal! where
has he learned the art of turning my weapons on
myself?"</p>

<p>The dismounted knight rose to his feet in anger,
and drawing his sword, challenged Tristram to a
fight on foot.</p>

<p>"First, tell me your name?" asked Tristram.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>"My name is Palamides."</p>

<p>"And what knight hate you most?"</p>

<p>"I hate Sir Tristram to the death. If we meet,
one of us must die."</p>

<p>"You need not go far to seek him. I am Tristram
de Lyonesse. Now do your worst."</p>

<p>At this Dinadan started, and struck his hand
sturdily on his knee, like one who has had a shock
of surprise. Nor was Palamides less astonished,
and he stood before Tristram like one in a sudden
revulsion of feeling.</p>

<p>"I pray you, Sir Tristram," he said, "to forgive
my ill-will and my unkind words. You are a noble
knight and worthy of the love of all honorable
warriors. I repent my truculent temper towards
you, and, if I live, will rather do you service than
assail you."</p>

<p>"I know your valor well," answered Tristram,
"and that it is anything but fear makes you speak
so. Therefore I thank you much for your kind
words. But if you have any shreds of ill-will
towards me I am ready to give you satisfaction."</p>

<p>"My wits have been astray," answered Palamides.
"There is no just reason why we should be at odds,
and I am ready to do you knightly service in all
things you may command."</p>

<p>"I take you at your word," cried Tristram, as he
grasped Palamides by the hand. "I have never
been your enemy, and know none whom I would
rather have as a friend."</p>

<p>"Would you?" cried Dinadan. "And would
have me as your fool, mayhap? By my knightly
faith, you have made a sweet butt of me! I came
into this country for your sake, and by the advice
of Sir Lancelot, though he would not tell me where
to find you. By Jove's ears, I never thought to
find you masquerading as a milk-brained coward."</p>

<p>"He could have told you," said Tristram, "for
I abode within his own castle. As for my little
sport, friend Dinadan, I cry you mercy."</p>

<p>"Faith, it is but one of my own jests, turned
against me," said Dinadan, with a merry laugh.
"I am pinked with my own dart. I forgive you,
old comrade; but I vow I did not know you had
such a jolly humor."</p>

<p>"It comes to one in your company," said Tristram,
laughing. "The disease is catching."</p>

<p>And so the four knights rode gayly onward, conversing
much as they went, and laying their plans
for the tournament.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h4>ON THE ROAD TO LONAZEP.</h4>


<p>The four knights rode onward in company until
they came in sight of the castle of Lonazep, where
they saw striking preparations for the tournament.
For not less than four hundred tents and pavilions
covered the plain outside the great circle of the lists,
and war-horses and knights in armor were there in
hundreds.</p>

<p>"Truly," said Tristram, "this is the royalest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
show that I ever saw."</p>

<p>"You forget," answered Palamides. "It had its
equal at the Castle of Maidens, where you won the
prize."</p>

<p>"And in that tournament which Galahalt of the
Long Isles held in Surluse there was as great a
gathering," said Dinadan.</p>

<p>"I was not there; who won the prize?" asked
Tristram.</p>

<p>"Lancelot du Lake, and the next after him was
the noble knight Lamorak de Galis."</p>

<p>"A noble fellow, indeed, I never met his better,
save Sir Lancelot. His murder was shameful, and
were they not the nephews of my lord Arthur that
slew him, by my faith they should die the death.
And this without prejudice to you, Sir Gareth."</p>

<p>"Say what you will on that point; I am with
you," answered Gareth. "Though my own brothers
did that bloody work, I hold not with them.
None of them love me, as you well know, and I have
left their company as murderers. Had I been by
when Lamorak was killed there might have been
another tale to tell."</p>

<p>"Truly that is well said of you," rejoined Tristram.
"I would rather have been there than to
have all the gold between here and Rome."</p>

<p>"And I also," said Palamides. "It is a burning
disgrace to the Round Table fellowship that such
a knight should have been ambushed and slain on
his way from a passage-at-arms where he had won
the prize of valor."</p>

<p>"Out on such treason!" cried Tristram. "The
tale of it makes my blood run cold."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>"And mine as well," said Gareth. "I can never
love or respect my brothers again for that ruthless
deed."</p>

<p>"Yet to speak of it is useless," said Palamides.
"His life is gone; we cannot bring it back again."</p>

<p>"There lies the pity," said Dinadan. "No matter
how good and noble a man may be, when he
stops breathing all else stops with him. By good
luck, though, the same rule holds with villains and
cowards. As for Gawaine and his brothers, except
you, Sir Gareth, they hate the best knights of the
Round Table, and Lancelot and his kindred above
all. Only that Lancelot is well aware of this, they
might draw him into as deadly a trap as they drew
poor Lamorak."</p>

<p>"Come, come, remember that Gareth is their
brother," said Palamides. "Let us change the subject.
Here is this tournament,&mdash;what part shall
we play here? My advice is that we four hold
together against all that may assail us."</p>

<p>"That is not my counsel," said Tristram. "By
their pavilions we may count on some four hundred
knights, and doubtless many of them worthy ones.
If we play the game of four against all comers
we are likely to find ourselves borne down by numbers.
Many good knights have lost the game by
taking too great odds. Manhood is of little avail
if it be not tempered by wisdom. If you think it
best we may try it, and see what we can do in
company, but, as a rule, I prefer to fight for my own
hand."</p>

<p>As they thus talked they rode away from Lonazep,
and in due time came to the banks of the Humber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
where they were surprised by a loud and grievous
cry that seemed full of doleful meaning. Looking
over the waters they saw approaching before the
wind a vessel richly draped with red silk. Not long
had they waited when it came to the shore, at a
point close by where they stood.</p>

<p>Seeing this strange thing and hearing the doleful
cries which came from the vessel, the knights gave
their horses in care of their squires, and approached
on foot, Tristram boarding the vessel. When he
reached the deck he saw there a bed with rich silken
coverings, on which lay a dead knight, armed save
the head, which was crimsoned with blood. And
through great gaps in his armor deadly wounds
could be seen.</p>

<p>"What means this?" said Tristram. "How
came this knight by his death?"</p>

<p>As he spoke he saw that a letter lay in the dead
knight's hand.</p>

<p>"Master mariners," he asked of those on board
the vessel, "what does this strange thing signify?"</p>

<p>"Sir knight," they answered, "by the letter
which the dead knight bears you may learn how
and for what cause he was slain, and what name
he bore. Yet first heed well this warning: No
man must take and read that letter unless he be a
knight of proved valor, and faithfully promises
to revenge the murder of this good warrior."</p>

<p>"There be those among us able to revenge him,"
answered Tristram. "And if he shall prove to have
been foully treated his death shall not go unredressed."</p>

<p>Therewith he took the letter from the knight's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
hand and opened it. Thus it read,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I, Hermance, king and lord of the Red City,
request of all knights-errant and all noble knights
of Arthur's court, that they find one knight who
will fight for my sake with two false brethren, whom
I brought up from nothingness and who have
feloniously and treacherously slain me. And it is
my will and desire that the valiant knight who
avenges my death shall become lord of my Red
City and all my castles."</p>

<p>"Sir," said the mariners, "the king and knight
that lies here dead was a man of great virtue and
noble prowess, and one who loved all knights-errant,
and, above all, those of King Arthur's court."</p>

<p>"It is a piteous case, truly," said Tristram. "I
would fain take the enterprise in hand myself, but
that I have made a solemn promise to take part
in this great tournament. It was for my sake in
especial that my lord Arthur made it, and I cannot
in honor and courtesy fail to attend it. Therefore
I am not free to undertake any adventure which
may keep me from the lists."</p>

<p>"I pray you, dear sir," said Palamides, who had
followed Tristram into the vessel, "to put this
enterprise into my hands. I promise to achieve
it worthily or to die in the effort."</p>

<p>"Be it so," said Tristram. "You may go if you
will. But first I wish your promise to return so
as to be with me at the tournament this day week,
if possible."</p>

<p>"That promise I freely give. If I be alive and
unhurt, and my task be not too arduous and long,
I shall be with you by that day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>This said, Tristram left the vessel, leaving Palamides
in it, and he, with Gareth and Dinadan, stood
watching it as the mariners hoisted its sails and it
glided swiftly away over long Humber. Not till
it was out of sight did they return to their horses,
and look about them.</p>

<p>As they did so they beheld near them a knight,
who came up unarmed save a sword, and saluted
them with all courtesy.</p>

<p>"Fair sirs," he said, "I pray you, as knights-errant,
to come and see my castle, and take such
fare as you may find there. This I heartily
request."</p>

<p>"That shall we willingly do, and thank you for
your courtesy," they answered, and rode with him
to his castle, which was near by.</p>

<p>Here they entered a richly-furnished hall, and,
having laid off their armor, took their seats at a
well-laden table. But when the host saw Tristram's
face, he knew him, and first grew pale and then
angry of countenance.</p>

<p>"Sir, mine host," said Tristram, on seeing this
threatening aspect, "what is wrong with you, I
pray?"</p>

<p>"I know you, Tristram de Lyonesse," answered
the knight, hotly. "You slew my brother. Honor
demands that I shall not seek revenge here, but I
give you warning that I will kill you when I meet
you outside my castle."</p>

<p>"I have no knowledge of you or your brother,"
answered Tristram. "But no man can say that I
ever killed any one except in fair and open fight.
If I have done as you say I stand ready to make
what amends are in my power."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>"I desire no amends," rejoined the knight.
"But I warn you to keep from me."</p>

<p>Tristram at this rose from the table and asked
for his arms, his companions following him. Seeking
their horses they rode away, but they had not
gone far from the castle when Dinadan saw a knight
following them, who was well armed, but bore no
shield.</p>

<p>"Take care of yourself, Sir Tristram," he said.
"Yonder comes our host to call you to account."</p>

<p>"Then I must abide him as I may," answered
Tristram.</p>

<p>Soon the knight came up, and, loudly bidding
Tristram to be on his guard, he rode furiously upon
him with couched spear. But his valor went beyond
his strength, for he was hurled over his horse's
croup.</p>

<p>Not content with this, he rose, mounted again,
and driving his horse at full speed upon Tristram,
struck him two hard blows on the helm.</p>

<p>"Sir knight," said Tristram, "I pray you leave
off this sport. I do not care to harm you after
having just eaten at your table, but beg you not
to try my patience too far."</p>

<p>The furious assailant would not cease, however,
and continued his assaults until Tristram was
provoked to anger. In the end he returned the
knight a blow with the full strength of his mighty
arm, so fierce a buffet, indeed, that the blood burst
out from the breathing holes of his helm, and he
fell to the earth and lay there like one dead.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">
<a name="Assault_Pg_42" id="Assault_Pg_42"></a><img src="images/p42.jpg" width="381" height="500" alt="THE ASSAULT OF SIR TRISTRAM." title="THE ASSAULT OF SIR TRISTRAM." />
<span class="caption">THE ASSAULT OF SIR TRISTRAM.</span>
</div>

<p>"I hope I have not killed him," said Tristram.
"I did not think to strike the man so hard a blow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
but I am not a log to stand at rest and let him
whet his sword on."</p>

<p>Leaving the fallen knight to the care of his squire,
they rode on; but not far had they gone when
they saw coming towards them two well-armed and
well-horsed knights, each with a good following of
servants. One of these was Berrant le Apres, he
who was called the king with the hundred knights,
and the other Sir Segwarides, both men of might
and renown.</p>

<p>When they came up the king looked at Dinadan,
who, through sport, had put on Tristram's helmet.
This he recognized as one he had seen before with
the queen of Northgalis, whom he loved. She had
given it to La Belle Isolde, and she to Tristram.</p>

<p>"Sir knight," asked Berrant, "whence had you
that helm?"</p>

<p>"Not from you, I fancy. What have you to say
to it?"</p>

<p>"That I will have a tilt with you, for the love
of her who once owned it. Therefore, defend
yourself."</p>

<p>So they drew asunder, and rode at each other
with all the speed of their horses. But Dinadan,
good knight as he was, was no match for the tough
and hardy warrior before him, and was sent, horse
and all, to the ground.</p>

<p>"I fancy I have something to say about the helmet
now," said Berrant, grimly. "Go take it off
him, and keep it," he ordered his servant.</p>

<p>"What will you do?" cried Tristram. "Hands
off, fellow. Touch not that helm."</p>

<p>"To what intent do you meddle, sir knight?"
demanded Berrant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>"To this intent, that the helm is mine. Nor
will you get it from me till you buy it at a dearer
price."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that as a challenge?" asked Berrant.
"Be it so, then; make ready."</p>

<p>Together they rode with all speed, but with a
change of fortune, for Berrant found himself thrust
over the tail of his horse. In a moment he was
on his feet, sprang briskly to his saddle, and, riding
in anger upon Tristram, struck at him fiercely with
his sword.</p>

<p>Tristram was not taken unawares, but in an
instant had his sword in hand. A fierce combat
followed, for the king with the hundred knights
was a warrior of tough sinews and tried valor,
but at the last he received such a buffet on the helm
that he fell forward on his horse's neck, stunned
and helpless.</p>

<p>"By my faith, that helmet has proved unlucky
for two of us," said Dinadan. "It brought me
a tumble, and now, sir king, you owe it a buzzing
head-piece."</p>

<p>"Who will joust with me?" asked Segwarides.</p>

<p>"It is your right," said Gareth to Dinadan, "but
I pray you let me have it."</p>

<p>"You are heartily welcome to it. One tumble
a day is enough for my weak appetite," answered
Dinadan. "I make you a free present of the
opportunity."</p>

<p>"That is no fair exchange," said Tristram.
"The joust is yours by right."</p>

<p>"But not by choice," rejoined Dinadan. "Good
faith, sir bruiser, I have lived long enough to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
when I have had my share, and that is a lesson
it would pay many of you battle-hungry knights
to learn."</p>

<p>Then Gareth and Segwarides rode together, the
result being that Gareth and his horse went in a
heap to the earth.</p>

<p>"Now," said Tristram, "the joust is yours."</p>

<p>"But the appetite is lacking," said Dinadan.
"I have even less stomach for it than before."</p>

<p>"Then will I try him."</p>

<p>With these words Tristram challenged Segwarides,
who received a sore fall in the joust that
followed. Then the three knights rode on, leaving
their late antagonists the worse in heart and limb
for the encounter.</p>

<p>They continued their ride till they reached Joyous
Gard. Here Gareth courteously declined to
enter the castle, but Tristram would not hear of
his departure, and made him alight and enter as
his guest. So they disarmed and had good cheer,
with La Belle Isolde as their hostess.</p>

<p>But Dinadan, when he came into the presence of
Isolde, roundly cursed the hour that he had been
persuaded to wear Tristram's helm, and told her of
how he had been mocked by his comrade knight.</p>

<p>Much laughing and jesting at Dinadan followed,
but this was a game in which he was quite able
to hold his own, however he might lack with sword
and spear. For Arthur's court held no other so
witty of tongue and merry of heart. And thus
in jest and feast they passed the hours happily
away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h4>HOW PALAMIDES FARED AT THE RED CITY.</h4>


<p>Leaving Tristram and his companions to their
merry talk in Joyous Gard, we must now return
to Palamides. The ship into which he had entered
sailed far along the Humber, until in time it reached
the open sea. It continued its course through the
sea-waves till it came to a part of the coast where
stood a stately castle.</p>

<p>All day and night they had sailed, and it was
now early in the morning, before day-dawn. Palamides
was sound asleep in the vessel's cabin when
the mariners came to call him.</p>

<p>"Sir knight," they said, "you must arise. We
have reached a castle, which you must enter."</p>

<p>"I am at your command," he replied.</p>

<p>Rising, he armed himself quickly, and then blew
a loud call upon a horn which the mariners gave
him.</p>

<p>At the ringing music of that bugle-blast the
sleeping castle seemed to stir into life. Soon many
eyes could be seen looking from the windows, and
ere long the walls were crowded with knights, who
called to Palamides as with one voice, "Welcome,
fair sir, to this castle."</p>

<p>The day had now fully dawned, and Palamides
entered the castle, where a crowd of knights came
to greet him, and led him to a stately dining-hall,
where an abundant breakfast awaited him. But
as he ate he heard much lamentation, and saw many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
whose eyes were wet with tears.</p>

<p>"What means this?" he asked. "I love not
such sorrow, and would fain know what gives rise
to it."</p>

<p>"We mourn here daily," answered a knight
named Sir Ebel, "and for this cause. We had a
king named Hermance, who was lord of the Red
City, and in every way a noble and generous monarch.
And he loved nothing in the world so much
as the knights-errant of King Arthur's court, together
with the sports of jousting, hunting, and all
knightly diversions. A king so kind of heart as he
was never before known in this country, and we shall
ever be filled with sorrow for his loss. Yet he acted
unwisely, and is himself at fault for his death."</p>

<p>"Tell me how he was slain and by whom,"
asked Palamides.</p>

<p>"In this wise it came to pass," answered Ebel.
"He brought up, in pure charity, two children,
who are now strong knights. And to them he gave
all his trust and confidence, in default of those
of his own blood. These two men governed him
completely, and, through him, his lands and people,
for they took the best of care that none of his kindred
should come into power. He was so free and
trustful, and they so politic and deceitful, that they
ruled him as though they were the kings and he the
subject. When the lords of our king's blood saw
that he had fallen into this dotage they left the court
in disgust, and sought their livelihood elsewhere.
This it proved not wise to do, for when these villains
found that all the king's kindred had left the
realm they schemed to have more power still; for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
as the old saw says, 'Give a churl rule in part, and
he will not be content till he has it all.' It is the
instinct of the base-born to destroy gentlemen-born,
if the power be put in their hands, and all rulers
should take warning by the fate of King Hermance.
In the end our king, by the advice of these traitors,
rode into the forest here by, to chase the red deer.
When he had become warm from the hunt he
alighted to drink at a woodland spring, and, while
he was bent over the water, one of these villains
thrust him through the body with a spear. They
then fled from the spot, thinking he was dead.
Shortly after they had gone, fortune brought me
to the spot, where I found my lord still alive, but
mortally hurt, and learned from him his story.
Knowing that we had no knights able to revenge
him on his murderers, I had him brought to the
water, and put into the ship alive, and the letter
which he bore in his hand I wrote from his own
words. Then he died, and, as he had ordered,
the ship set sail up the Humber, bound for the realm
of Logris, where it was hoped that some valiant
Knight of the Round Table would take this adventure
on himself."</p>

<p>"Truly your doleful tale grieves me sorely,"
said Palamides. "I saw the letter you speak of.
It was read to me by one of the best knights upon
the earth, and it is by his command I am here. I
came to revenge your king, and I shall never be
at ease till I meet with and punish his murderers."</p>

<p>"You have my hearty thanks and best wishes,"
said Ebel. "Since you accept this adventure, you
must enter the ship again, and sail forward till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
you reach the Delectable Isle, which is near by the
Red City. We shall await here your return. If
you speed well this castle is yours. King Hermance
built it for the two traitors, but we hold it against
them, and they threaten us sorely unless we yield
it."</p>

<p>"Look that you keep it, whatsoever may come
to me," said Palamides. "For if fortune decides
that I am to be slain in this quest, I trust that one
of the best knights in the world will come to
revenge me; either Tristram de Lyonesse or Lancelot
du Lake."</p>

<p>Then Palamides entered the ship and sailed away
towards the Red City. But as he came near it,
and landed on the coast, another ship touched shore
near by, from which came a goodly knight, with his
shield on his shoulder and his hand on his sword.</p>

<p>"Sir knight, what seek you here?" he asked
Palamides. "If you have come to revenge King
Hermance you must yield this quest to me, for
it was mine before it was yours, and I shall yield
it to no man."</p>

<p>"You speak like a true knight," said Palamides.
"But when the letter was taken from the dead
king's hand there was nothing known of any champion
for him, and so I promised to revenge him.
And this I must and shall do, lest I win shame
instead of honor."</p>

<p>"You have right on your side," said the knight.
"What I propose is this. I will fight with you;
and he who proves the better knight shall have
the quest."</p>

<p>"That fits with my fancy," said Palamides; "for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
from what I hear no second-rate champion can
watch this pair of villains."</p>

<p>With this they advanced their shields and drew
their swords, and began a stern and well-contested
combat. For more than an hour the fight between
them continued, but at the end of this time Palamides
seemed stronger and better-winded than at
the beginning, and he finally dealt his opponent a
blow that brought him to his knees. Then the
discomfited combatant cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Knight, hold your hand."</p>

<p>Palamides let fall his sword at this request.</p>

<p>"You are the better of us two, and more worthy
of this battle," said the knight. "But fain would
I know your name."</p>

<p>"My name is Palamides. I am a Knight of the
Round Table, and one well known in Arthur's
realm."</p>

<p>"In good faith it is, and much beyond that
realm," answered the knight. "I know only three
living men besides yourself who are fitted for this
task, and they are Lancelot, Tristram, and my
cousin Lamorak. As for me, my name is Hermind,
and I am brother to the murdered King Hermance."</p>

<p>"I shall do my best to revenge your brother,"
said Palamides. "If I am slain, I commend you
to Lancelot or Tristram. As for Lamorak, he will
never strike blow again."</p>

<p>"Alas, what mean you?"</p>

<p>"That he has been murdered&mdash;waylaid and slain
treacherously by Gawaine and his brothers, except
Sir Gareth, the best of them all." And he told the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
story of the death of Lamorak, much to the grief
and indignation of his hearer.</p>

<p>Then Palamides took ship again, and sailed on
till he came to the Delectable Isle. Meanwhile
Hermind made all haste to the Red City, where
he told of the arrival of the famous knight Palamides
and of his combat with him. The people
were filled with joy at these tidings, and quickly
sent a messenger to the two brethren, bidding them
to make ready, as a knight had come who would
fight them both. The messenger found them at a
castle near by, and delivered his message.</p>

<p>"Who is this champion?" they asked. "Is it
Lancelot or any of his blood?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"If it were, we would not fight. But we care
for no one else."</p>

<p>"It is a good knight though, Sir Palamides, a
Saracen by birth, and still unchristened."</p>

<p>"He had best have been christened before he
came here, for it will be too late when we have
done with him. Let him know that we will be
at the Red City in two days, and will give him
all the fighting he is likely to want for the rest
of his life."</p>

<p>When Palamides came to the city he was received
with the greatest joy, and the more so when
the people saw what a handsome and well-built
man he was, neither too young nor too old, with
clean and powerful limbs, and no defect of body.</p>

<p>At the time appointed there came to the city the
two brethren, Helius and Helake by name, both of
them strong and valiant men, of great prowess in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
war, false as they were at heart. And with them
they brought forty knights, to guard them against
any treachery from the Red City, for they knew
well that it was filled with their enemies.</p>

<p>The lists had already been prepared, and at the
appointed hour Palamides entered full armed, and
confronted his antagonists boldly.</p>

<p>"Are you the two brethren Helius and Helake,
who slew your king by treason?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We are the men who slew King Hermance,"
they replied. "And bear in mind, Sir Saracen,
we are able to stand by our deeds, and will handle
you so before you depart that you will wish you
had been christened before you came so far."</p>

<p>"I trust to God I shall die a better Christian
than either of you," Palamides replied. "And
you had best kill me if you get the chance, for I
vow not to spare you."</p>

<p>As he spoke the trumpet sounded, and, reining
back their horses, they rode against each other with
terrific speed. Palamides directed his spear against
Helake, and struck him so mighty a blow that the
spear pierced through his shield and hauberk, and
for a fathom's length through his breast, hurling
him dead to the earth. As for Helius, he held up
his spear in pride and presumption, and rode by
Palamides without touching him.</p>

<p>But when he saw his brother stretched in death
on the earth his assurance changed to doubt, and
rage drove the pride from his heart. "Help thyself,
villain!" he cried, and rushed upon Palamides
before he could prepare to encounter him, striking
him a blow with his spear that bore him from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
saddle to the earth. Then he forced his horse over
him backward and forward before the dismounted
champion could regain his feet.</p>

<p>As he came again, the fallen knight reached up
and caught the horse by the bridle, dragging himself
by its aid to his feet. Then, as the animal
reared, he pressed so strongly upon it that it toppled
backward to the ground, the rider barely saving
himself from being crushed beneath his fallen horse.
But he was on his feet in an instant, and, sword in
hand, struck Palamides a blow on the helm that
brought him down to one knee.</p>

<p>Before he could repeat the blow the gallant Saracen
was on his feet and had drawn his trenchant
blade, with which he attacked his antagonist in
turn. A fierce and deadly combat succeeded, the
two knights hurtling together like two wild boars,
now both hurled grovelling to the earth, now on
foot again and hewing at each other with the
strength of giants.</p>

<p>Thus for two hours they fought, without time
for rest or a moment's space to recover breath.
At the end of that time Palamides grew faint and
weary from the violence of his efforts, but Helius
seemed as strong as ever, and redoubling his strokes
he drove back the Saracen knight step by step,
over all the field. At this the people of the city
were filled with fear, while the party of Helius
shouted with triumph.</p>

<p>"Alas!" cried the citizens, "that this noble
knight should be slain for our king's sake."</p>

<p>While they thus bewailed his threatened fate and
the seeming victory of their tyrant, Helius showered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
so many vigorous blows on his weakened foe that
it was a wonder he kept his feet. But when he
saw how the common people wept for him his heart
was filled with a sense of shame, while a glow of
fury burned like fire in his veins.</p>

<p>"Fie on you for a dastard, Palamides!" he said
to himself. "Why hang you your head so like a
whipped hound?"</p>

<p>Then, with a new spirit burning hotly within
him, and fresh strength animating his limbs, he
lifted his drooping shield and turned on Helius
with lion-like fury, smiting him a vigorous blow
on the helm, which he followed quickly by others.
This violent onset was too much for the strained
strength of the false knight, and he retreated in
dismay, while the sword of Palamides fell with ever
more and more might. At length came so mighty
a blow that he was hurled like a log to the earth.
The victorious Saracen gave him no time to recover,
but sprang upon him like a fury, tore the
helm from his head, and with a final stroke smote
the head from his body.</p>

<p>Then he rose and stood leaning upon his sword,
hardly able to bear himself on his feet, while from
all the people of the city went up loud shouts of
joy and congratulation.</p>

<p>"Palamides, the conqueror! Palamides, our deliverer!
Palamides, our king!" they shouted,
while one adorned his brows with a wreath of laurel,
and others tore off his armor and applied ointments
to his bleeding limbs.</p>

<p>"Fair friends, your crown is not for me," he
said. "I have delivered you from your tyrants,
but you must choose some other king, as I am
under promise to return with all speed to my lord
King Arthur at the castle of Lonazep."</p>

<p>This decision filled them with grief, but they
brought him to the city and treated him with all
the honor which they could bestow upon him. And
as he persisted in his refusal of the crown, they
proffered him a third part of their goods if he
would remain with them. All this he declined,
and in a short time departed, bearing with him a
thousand good wishes and prayers for success and
fortune.</p>

<p>He was received with like joy and congratulation
at the castle, Sir Ebel warmly pressing him
to change his decision and remain as their king.
To this Palamides would by no means consent,
and after a day's stay he took ship again, and
sailed up the Humber to the castle of Lonazep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h4>THE TOURNAMENT AT LONAZEP.</h4>


<p>When Palamides learned that Tristram was not
at Lonazep, he tarried not there, but crossed the
Humber, and sought him at Joyous Gard. Here
he found lodgings in the town, and word was
quickly brought to Tristram that a knight-errant
had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>"What manner of man is he? and what sign does
he bear?" he asked.</p>

<p>The messenger described his armor and appearance.</p>

<p>"That is Palamides," said Dinadan. "The
brave fellow is already back, and victorious, I
doubt not."</p>

<p>"It looks that way, indeed. Go and bid him
welcome to Joyous Gard," said Tristram.</p>

<p>So Dinadan went to Palamides, and joyfully
greeted him, listening eagerly to the story of his
exploits, and congratulating him on his signal success.
He remained with him that night, and in
the morning they were visited by Tristram and
Gareth before they had arisen.</p>

<p>Many were the warm congratulations which Tristram
gave Palamides on his noble achievement,
and after they had breakfasted he invited him to
ride into the fields and woods, that they might
repose under the cool shelter of the forest. Here
they alighted by a refreshing spring, and as they
sat conversing an armed knight came riding towards
them.</p>

<p>"Who are those knights that are lodged in Joyous
Gard?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That I cannot say," answered Tristram.</p>

<p>"At any rate you can tell me who you are. You
are not knights-errant, I fancy, since you ride
unarmed."</p>

<p>"Whether we be or no, we prefer not to tell our
names."</p>

<p>"You are not courteous, sir knight, and this is
the way I pay discourtesy," said the stranger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
"Guard yourself, or you shall die by my hands."</p>

<p>Then, spear in hand, he rode on Sir Tristram,
with brutal intent to run him through. But Palamides
sprang up hastily, and smote the knight's
horse so fierce a blow with his clinched fist that
horse and man fell together to the earth. He then
drew his sword to slay him.</p>

<p>"Let the dog go," said Tristram. "He is but
a fool, and it were a shame to slay him for his
folly. Take the fellow's spear from him, though.
It is a weapon he has not learned the use of."</p>

<p>The knight rose groaning, and when he had
regained his saddle he again requested their names.</p>

<p>"My name is Tristram de Lyonesse, and this
knight's name is Palamides. Would you know
more?"</p>

<p>"No, by my faith!" cried the other, and, hastily
putting spurs to his horse, he rode away as
fast as the animal would carry him.</p>

<p>Hardly had he gone when a knight, who bore
a bended shield of azure, came riding up at a
furious gallop.</p>

<p>"My fair sirs," he asked, "has a knight passed
here bearing a shield with a case of red over it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We but now had some trouble with such
a fellow. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"And you let him escape? That was ill-advised,
fair sirs. He is the falsest rogue and the greatest
foe to knights-errant living. His name is Breuse
Sans Pité."</p>

<p>"And I had him under my sword!" cried Palamides.
"Fool I was to let him go."</p>

<p>"If I overtake him there will be another story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
to tell," answered the knight, as he spurred onward
on the track of the fugitive.</p>

<p>Then the four friends mounted and rode leisurely
back towards Joyous Gard, much conversing as they
went. When they reached the castle Palamides
wished not to enter, but Tristram insisted on it,
and, taking him by the hand, led him in.</p>

<p>When Palamides saw La Belle Isolde, whom he
had not met for years, but for whom his love burned
as warmly as ever, he was so ravished with joy
that he could scarcely speak. And when they were
at dinner he could not eat a morsel, but sat like a
dumb man, scarcely venturing to raise his eyes to
Isolde's lovely countenance.</p>

<p>Poorly he slept that night, and with many
dreams of her he loved. When morning broke they
all prepared to ride to Lonazep. Tristram took
with him three squires, and Queen Isolde had three
gentlewomen, all attired with great richness.
These, with the other knights and their squires,
and valets to bear their shields and spears, formed
their train.</p>

<p>Not far had they gone before they saw on the
road before them a group of knights. Chief of
these was the knight Galihodin, who was attended
by twenty companions.</p>

<p>"Fair fellows," said Galihodin, "yonder come
four knights escorting a richly-attired lady. What
say you? shall we take her from them?"</p>

<p>"That is not the best counsel," said one.</p>

<p>"At any rate, it is my counsel," answered Galihodin.
"We shall show them that we have the
right of the road." And he sent a squire to them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
asking them if they would joust, or else lose their
lady.</p>

<p>"We are but four," said Tristram. "Tell your
lord to come with three of his comrades, and win
her if he can."</p>

<p>"Let me have this joust," said Palamides. "I
will undertake them all four."</p>

<p>"As you will," said Tristram. "Go tell your
lord that this one knight will encounter him and
any three of his fellows."</p>

<p>The squire departed with his challenge, and in
a trice Galihodin came riding forward spear in
rest. Palamides encountered him in mid career,
and smote him so hard a blow that he had a terrible
fall to the earth, and his horse with him.
His three comrades were served in the same summary
manner, while Palamides still bore an unbroken
spear. At this unlooked-for result six
knights rode out from the opposite party with
purpose of revenge on the victor.</p>

<p>"Hold your hands," cried Galihodin. "Let not
one of you touch this noble knight, who has proved
himself a man of worth. And I doubt if the whole
of you could handle him."</p>

<p>When Palamides saw that the field was yielded
to him he rode back to Sir Tristram.</p>

<p>"Well and worshipfully have you done," said
Tristram. "No man could have surpassed you."</p>

<p>Onward they rode again, and in a little while
after met four knights in the highway, with spears
in rest. These were Gawaine and three companions.
This joust also Tristram gave to Palamides, and
he served these four as he had served the others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
leaving them all unhorsed in the road. For the
presence of La Belle Isolde gave the strength of
ten men to the arm of her lover, the Saracen.</p>

<p>They now continued their route without molestation,
and in good time reached the spot where
Tristram had ordered his pavilions to be set up.
Here were now many more pavilions than they
had seen on their previous visit, and a great array
of knights, who had been gathering for many
days, for far and wide had spread the news of the
great tournament.</p>

<p>Leaving Palamides and Gareth at the pavilions
with Queen Isolde, Tristram and Dinadan rode to
Lonazep to learn what was afoot, Tristram riding
on the Saracen knight's white horse. As they
came into the castle the sound of a great bugle-blast
met their ears, and many knights crowded
forward.</p>

<p>"What means the blast?" asked Tristram.</p>

<p>"Sir," answered a knight, "it comes from the
party who hold against King Arthur at this tournament.
These are the kings of Ireland, of Surluse,
of Listinoise, of Northumberland, of North Wales,
and of other countries. They are calling a council
to decide how they shall be governed in the lists."</p>

<p>Tristram thereupon followed them to their council,
and listened to the debate. He then sought
his horse again, and rode by where King Arthur
stood surrounded by a press of knights. Among
those were Galihodin and Gawaine, who said to the
king: "That knight in the green harness, with
the white horse, is a man of might, whoever he
be. To-day he overthrew us both, with six of our
fellows."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>"Who can he be?" said the king, and he called
Tristram to him, and requested to know his name.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, my liege lord," answered Tristram,
"and pray that you will hold me excused
from revealing my name at this time," and he
turned his horse and rode away.</p>

<p>"Go after him, Sir Griflet," said the king.
"Tell him that I wish to speak with him apart."</p>

<p>Griflet rode to Tristram and told him the king's
wish, and the two returned in company.</p>

<p>"Fair sir," said the king, "what is the cause
that you withhold your name?"</p>

<p>"I have an excellent reason, but beg that you
will not press me for it."</p>

<p>"With which party do you hold?"</p>

<p>"Truly, my lord, that I cannot say. Where my
heart draws or my fancy bids I will go. To-morrow
you shall see which side I take. To-day
I know not myself."</p>

<p>Leaving the king, he rode back to where his
pavilions were set. When the morning dawned he
and his three companions armed themselves all in
green and rode to the lists. Here young knights
had begun to joust, and, seeing this, Gareth asked
leave of Tristram to break a spear.</p>

<p>"Go in and do your best if you care to play with
beginners," said Tristram, laughing.</p>

<p>But Gareth found himself encountered by a
nephew of the king with the hundred knights,
who had some of his uncle's tough fibre, and both
got ugly falls, and lay on the ground till they
were helped up by their friends. Then Tristram
and Palamides rode with Gareth back to the pavilions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
where they removed their helmets. When
Isolde saw Gareth all bruised in the face, she
asked him what ailed him.</p>

<p>"Madam, I had a hard buffet, and gave another,
but none of my fellows would rescue me."</p>

<p>"Only unproved knights are yet in the field,"
said Palamides. "The man that met you, though,
was a strong and well-trained knight, Sir Selises
by name, so you have no dishonor. Rest here and
get yourself in condition for to-morrow's work."</p>

<p>"I shall not fail you if I can bestride my horse,"
said Gareth.</p>

<p>"What party is it best for us to join to-morrow?"
asked Tristram.</p>

<p>"Against King Arthur, is my advice," said Palamides.
"Lancelot and many other good men will
be on his side, and the more men of prowess we
meet the more honor we will win."</p>

<p>"Well and knightly spoken," said Tristram.
"Hard blows is what we court. Your counsel is
well given."</p>

<p>"So think we all," said the others.</p>

<p>On the morrow, when day had broken, they
arrayed themselves in green trappings, with shields
and spears of green, while Isolde and her three
damsels wore dresses of the same color. For the
ladies Tristram found seats in a bay window of a
priory which overlooked the field, and from which
they could see all that took place. This done, they
rode straight to the party of the king of Scots.</p>

<p>When Arthur saw this he asked Lancelot who
were these knights and the queenly lady who came
with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>"That I cannot say for certain. Yet if Tristram
and Palamides be in this country then it is
they and La Belle Isolde."</p>

<p>Then Arthur turned to Kay and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go to the hall and see how many Knights of
the Round Table are missing, and bring me word."</p>

<p>Kay did so, and found by the roll of knights
that ten were wanting,&mdash;Tristram, Dinadan, and
eight others.</p>

<p>"Then I dare say," remarked Arthur, "that
some of these are here to-day against us."</p>

<p>The tournament began with a combat in which
two knights, cousins to Gawaine, named Sir Edward
and Sir Sadok, rode against the king of Scots
and the king of North Wales and overthrew them
both. This Palamides saw, and in return he
spurred upon these victorious knights and hurled
both of them from their saddles.</p>

<p>"What knight is that in green?" asked Arthur.
"He is a mighty jouster."</p>

<p>"You will see him do better yet," said Gawaine.
"It was he that unhorsed me and seven others
two days ago."</p>

<p>As they stood talking Tristram rode into the
lists on a black horse, and within a few minutes
he smote down four knights of Orkney, while
Gareth and Dinadan each unhorsed a good knight.</p>

<p>"Yonder is another fellow of marvellous arm,"
said Arthur; "that green knight on the black
horse."</p>

<p>"He has not begun his work yet," said Gawaine.
"It is plain that he is no common man."</p>

<p>And so it proved, for Sir Tristram pushed fiercely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
into the press, rescued the two kings who had been
unhorsed, and did such mighty work among the
opposing party that all who saw him marvelled to
behold one man do so many valiant deeds. Nor
was the career of Palamides less marvellous to the
spectators.</p>

<p>King Arthur, who watched them both with admiring
eyes, likened Tristram to a furious lion,
and Palamides to a maddened leopard, and Gareth
and Dinadan, who seconded them strongly, to eager
wolves. So fiercely did Tristram rage, indeed,
among the knights of Orkney that at length they
withdrew from the field, as no longer able to face
him.</p>

<p>Then loud went up the cry of the heralds and
the common people,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The green knight has beaten all Orkney!"
And the heralds took account that not less than fifty
knights had been smitten down by the four champions
in green.</p>

<p>"This will not do," said Arthur. "Our party
will be overmatched if these fellows rage on at
such a rate. Come, Lancelot, you and Hector and
Bleoberis must try your hands, and I will make a
fourth."</p>

<p>"Let it be so," answered Lancelot. "Let me
take him on the black horse, and Bleoberis him on
the white. Hector shall match him on the gray
horse" (Sir Gareth).</p>

<p>"And I," said Arthur, "will face the knight on
the grizzled steed" (Sir Dinadan).</p>

<p>With this conversation they armed and rode to
the lists. Here Lancelot rode against Tristram and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
smote him so hard a blow that horse and man
went to the earth, while his three companions met
with the same ill fortune from their new antagonists.</p>

<p>This disaster raised a cry throughout the lists:
"The green knights are down! Rescue the green
knights! Let them not be held prisoners!" For
the understanding was that any unhorsed knight
not rescued by his own strength or by his fellows
should be held as prisoner.</p>

<p>Then the king of North Wales rode straight to
Tristram, and sprang from his horse, crying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Noble knight, I know not of what country
you are, but beg you to take my horse, for you
have proved yourself worthier to bestride it than
I am."</p>

<p>"Many thanks," said Tristram. "I shall try
and do you as welcome a turn. Keep near us, and
I may soon win you another horse."</p>

<p>Then he sprang to the saddle, and meeting with
King Arthur struck him so fierce a sword-blow
on the helm that he had no power to keep his
saddle.</p>

<p>"Here is the horse promised you," cried Tristram
to the king of North Wales, who was quickly
remounted on King Arthur's horse.</p>

<p>Then came a hot contest around the king, one
party seeking to mount him again and the other
to hold him prisoner. Palamides thrust himself,
on foot, into the press, striking such mighty blows
to the right and left that the whole throng were
borne back before him. At the same time Tristram
rode into the thickest of the throng of knights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and cut a way through them, hurling many of them
to the earth.</p>

<p>This done, he left the lists and rode to his pavilion,
where he changed his horse and armor; he
who had gone forth as a green knight coming back
to the fray as a red one.</p>

<p>When Queen Isolde saw that Tristram was unhorsed,
and lost sight of him in the press, she wept
greatly, fearing that some harm had come to him.
But when he rode back she knew him in an instant,
despite his red disguise, and her heart swelled
anew with joy as she saw him with one spear smite
down five knights. Lancelot, too, now knew him,
and withdrew from the lists lest he should encounter
him again.</p>

<p>All this time Tristram's three friends had not
been able to regain their saddles, but now he drove
back the press and helped them again to horse,
and, though they knew him not in his new array,
they aided him with all their knightly prowess.</p>

<p>When Isolde, at her window, saw what havoc her
chosen knight was making, she leaned eagerly forth
and laughed and smiled in delight. This Palamides
saw, and the vision of her lovely and smiling
countenance filled his soul so deeply with love's
rejoicing that there seemed to flow into him the
strength and spirit of ten men, and, with a shout
of knightly challenge, he pressed forward, smiting
down with spear and sword every man he encountered.
For his heart was so enamoured by the
vision of that charming face that Tristram or
Lancelot would then have had much ado to stand
before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>"Truly Palamides is a noble warrior," said
Tristram, when he beheld this. "I never saw him
do such deeds as he has done this day, nor heard
of his showing such prowess."</p>

<p>"It is his day," said Dinadan, simply. But to
himself he said, "If you knew for whose love he
does these valorous deeds, you would soon be in
the field against him."</p>

<p>"It is a crying pity that so brave a knight should
be a pagan," said Tristram.</p>

<p>"It is my fancy," said Dinadan to himself,
"that you may thank Queen Isolde for what you
have seen; if she had not been here to-day that
shouting throng would not be giving Palamides
the palm of the tourney."</p>

<p>At this juncture Lancelot came again into the
field, and hearing the outcry in favor of Palamides
he set his spear in rest and spurred upon him.
Palamides, seeing this, and having no spear, coolly
awaited Lancelot, and as he came up smote his
spear in two with a sword-stroke. Then he rushed
upon him and struck his horse so hard a blow in
the neck that the animal fell, bearing his rider to
the ground.</p>

<p>Loud and fierce was the outcry then: "Palamides
the Saracen has smitten Sir Lancelot's horse!
It is an unknightly deed!"</p>

<p>And Hector de Maris, seeing his brother Lancelot
thus unfairly dismounted, rushed upon Palamides
in a rage, and bore him from his horse with
a mighty spear-thrust.</p>

<p>"Take heed to yourself, sirrah," cried Lancelot,
springing towards him sword in hand. "You have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
done me a sorry deed, and by my knightly honor
I will repay you for it."</p>

<p>"I humbly beg your pardon, noble sir," answered
Palamides. "I have done so much this
day that I have no power or strength left to withstand
you. Forgive me my hasty and uncourteous
deed, and I promise to be your knight while I
live."</p>

<p>"You have done marvellously well indeed," said
Lancelot. "I understand well what power moves
you. Love is a mighty mistress, and if she I love
were here to-day you should not bear away the honor
of the field, though you have nobly won it. Beware
that Tristram discovers not your love, or you may
repent it. But I have no quarrel with you, and
will not seek to take from you the honor of the
day."</p>

<p>So Lancelot suffered Palamides to depart, and
mounted his own horse again, despite twenty
knights who sought to hinder him. Lancelot, Tristram,
and Palamides did many more noble deeds
before that day's end, and so great became the
medley at length that the field seemed a dense mass
of rearing and plunging horses and struggling
knights.</p>

<p>At length Arthur bade the heralds to blow to
lodging and the fray ended. And since Palamides
had been in the field from first to last, without once
withdrawing, and had done so many, noble and
valiant deeds, the honor and the prize for the
day were unanimously voted him, a judgment which
Arthur and the kings of his counsel unanimously
confirmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>But when Palamides came to understand that
the red knight who had rescued him was Sir Tristram
his heart was glad, for all but Dinadan fancied
he had been taken prisoner. Much was the talk
upon the events of the day, and great the wonder of
king and knights at the remarkable valor of the
Saracen knight.</p>

<p>"And yet I well know," said Lancelot, "that
there was a better knight there than he. And
take my word for it, this will be proved before the
tournament ends."</p>

<p>This also thought Dinadan, and he rallied his
friend Tristram with satirical tongue.</p>

<p>"What the fiend has ailed you to-day?" he
asked. "Palamides grew in strength from first
to last, but you have been like a man asleep, or a
coward knight."</p>

<p>"I was never called coward before," said Tristram,
hotly. "The only fall I got was from Lancelot,
and him I hold as my better, and for that
matter the better of any man alive."</p>

<p>But Dinadan kept up his railing accusations till
the growing anger of Tristram warned him to desist.
Yet this was all from friendship, not from
spite, for he wished to stir up his friend to do his
best in the lists the coming day, and not permit
the Saracen again to carry off the prize.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h4>THE SECOND DAY OF THE TOURNAMENT.</h4>


<p>When the next morning dawned, Tristram, Palamides,
and Gareth, with La Belle Isolde and her
ladies, all arrayed as before in green, took horse
at an early hour, and rode into the fresh forest.
But Dinadan was left still asleep in bed. As they
passed the castle at a little distance, it chanced
that King Arthur and Lancelot saw them from an
upper window.</p>

<p>"Yonder rideth the fairest lady of the world,"
said Lancelot, "always excepting your queen, Guenever."</p>

<p>"Who is it?" asked Arthur.</p>

<p>"It is La Belle Isolde, Cornwall's queen and
Tristram's lady-love."</p>

<p>"By my troth, I should like to see her closer,"
said the king. "Let us arm and mount, and ride
after them."</p>

<p>This they did, and in a short time were on the
track of the gay cavalcade they had seen.</p>

<p>"Let us not be too hasty," warned Lancelot.
"There are some knights who resent being intruded
on abruptly; particularly if in the company of
ladies."</p>

<p>"As for that, we must take our chances," said
Arthur. "If they feel aggrieved I cannot help
it, for I am bent on seeing Queen Isolde."</p>

<p>Seeing Tristram and his companions just in advance,
Arthur rode briskly up and saluted Isolde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
courteously, saying, "God save you, fair lady."</p>

<p>"Thanks for your courtesy, sir knight," she
replied.</p>

<p>Then Arthur looked upon her charming countenance,
freshened by the morning air, and thought
in his mind that Lancelot had spoken but the truth,
and that no more beautiful lady lived. But at this
moment Palamides rode up.</p>

<p>"Sir knight, what seek you here?" he asked.
"It is uncourteous to come on a lady so suddenly.
Your intrusion is not to our liking, and I bid you
to withdraw."</p>

<p>Arthur paid no heed to these words, but continued
to gaze upon Isolde, as one stricken with
admiration. Seeing this, Palamides flamed into
anger, and spurred fiercely upon the king, with
spear in rest, smiting him from his horse.</p>

<p>"Here is an awkward business," said Lancelot
to himself. "If I ride down Palamides I shall
have Tristram on me; and the pair of them would
be too much for me. This comes from too head-strong
a will. But whether I live or die I must
stand by my lord and king." Then riding forward,
he called to Palamides, "Keep thee from me!"</p>

<p>Fierce was the onset with which they met, but it
ended in Lancelot's favor, for Palamides was flung
from his saddle and had a hard fall.</p>

<p>When Tristram saw this he called to Lancelot,
"Be on your guard, sir knight. You have unhorsed
my comrade, and must joust with me."</p>

<p>"I have no dread of that," said Lancelot; "and
yet I did but avenge my lord, who was unhorsed
unwarily and unknightly. You have no cause for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
displeasure; for no honorable knight could stand
by and see his friend ill-treated."</p>

<p>Tristram now felt sure that it was Lancelot who
spoke, and that it was King Arthur whom Palamides
had unhorsed. He therefore laid aside his
spear and helped Palamides again to his saddle,
while Lancelot did the same for the king.</p>

<p>"That deed of thine was not knightly nor courteous,"
said Tristram, sternly to Palamides, after
the others had departed. "I cannot see any harm
in a knight accosting a lady gently and courteously;
nor am I pleased to have you play such masteries
before my lady. If I deem her insulted, I am quite
able myself to protect her. And if I am not mistaken,
it was King Arthur you assailed so rudely,
and the other was Lancelot du Lake. You may yet
have to pay for your violence."</p>

<p>"I cannot think," said Palamides, "that the
great Arthur would ride thus secretly arrayed as
a poor knight-errant."</p>

<p>"Then you know him not," said Tristram. "No
knight living is fonder of adventure. King Arthur
is always ready to take his part as an errant knight,
nor does he bear malice against those who may
overthrow him when in disguise. I tell you, Palamides,
that our king is the true model of knightly
honor, and that the best of us might learn from
him."</p>

<p>"If it were he I am sorry," said Palamides. "I
may have been over-hasty. But a thing that is
done cannot be undone, and I must abide the consequences."</p>

<p>Then Tristram sent Isolde to her lodging in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
priory, from which she might behold the tournament,
and made ready to enter the lists.</p>

<p>Fierce was the shock of the first encounter of the
knights, and the three champions in green began
the day with many deeds of might.</p>

<p>"How feel you?" asked Tristram of Palamides.
"Are you able to repeat yesterday's work?"</p>

<p>"Hardly," was the reply. "I am weary and
sore yet from my hard labors."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for that, as I shall miss your aid."</p>

<p>"Trust not to me," answered Palamides. "I
have not much work left in me."</p>

<p>"Then I must depend on you," said Tristram
to Gareth. "We two should be able to make our
mark. Keep near me and rescue me if I get in
trouble, and I will do the same for you."</p>

<p>"I shall not fail you," was the reply.</p>

<p>Leaving them, Palamides rode off by himself,
and, pushing into the thickest press of the men
of Orkney, did such deeds of arms that Tristram
looked on in amazement.</p>

<p>"Is that his soreness and weariness?" he asked.
"I fancy he is weary of my company, and wishes
to win all the honor to his own hand."</p>

<p>"That is what Dinadan meant yesterday when
he called you coward," said Gareth. "He but
wished to stir you to anger so that Palamides should
not rob you of credit."</p>

<p>"By my faith, if Palamides bears me ill will and
envy I shall show him what a knight of Cornwall
can do. He has gained the acclamations of the
crowd already. He has left our company and we
owe him no courtesy. You shall see me rob him
of his honors."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>Then Tristram rode into the thickest of the press,
and laid about him with such might that all eyes
were turned upon him, and men began to say,
"There is a greater than Palamides come into the
field."</p>

<p>"Is it not as I told you?" said Lancelot to
Arthur. "I said you would this day see the Saracen
distanced."</p>

<p>"It is true enough," answered Arthur. "Palamides
has not such strength of arm."</p>

<p>"It is Tristram himself you look upon."</p>

<p>"That I can well believe," said Arthur. "Such
knights as he do not grow like mushrooms in every
field."</p>

<p>The noise from the other part of the lists now
drew the attention of Palamides, and when he saw
what puissant deeds his late comrade was doing
he wept for spite, for he saw that the honor of that
day was not for him.</p>

<p>Seeing to what straits their party was put,
Arthur and Lancelot and many other knights now
armed and rode into the field, and by their aid so
changed the tide of victory that the other side was
driven quite back, until Tristram and Gareth stood
alone, bravely abiding all who came upon them.
But Lancelot and his kinsmen kept purposely away
from them.</p>

<p>"See," said Lancelot to Arthur, "how Palamides
hovers yonder like one in a dream, sick, I
fancy, from envy of Tristram."</p>

<p>"Then he is but a fool," said the king. "He
is not and never was the match of Tristram. I
am glad to see the fellow repaid for the way he
served me this morning."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>As they stood thus conversing, Tristram withdrew
quietly from the lists, his going noted only
by Isolde and Palamides, who kept their eyes upon
him. He rode back to his pavilions, where he
found Dinadan still asleep, his slumbers not broken
by all the uproar of the tournament.</p>

<p>"As I am a living man, here is a lusty sleeper,"
cried Tristram. "Wake, Dinadan. The day is
half spent and the field half won, and here you are
still a-bed."</p>

<p>At this Dinadan sprang hastily up and rubbed
his eyes.</p>

<p>"I dreamt of wars and jousts," he said. "And,
i' faith, I like that way the best, for one gets all
the good of the fight and is safe from sore limbs
and aching bones. But what's to do?"</p>

<p>"Get on your harness and ride with me to the
field. You will find something there to waken
you up."</p>

<p>Dinadan, as he armed, noted Tristram's battered
shield, and remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I slept both well and wisely, it seems. If I
had been there I must have followed you, from
shame if not from courage. And by the looks of
your shield I would have been worse battered than
I was yesterday. Why did you not let me sleep
out the balance of it, friend Tristram?"</p>

<p>"A truce with your jests. Come, we must to
the field again."</p>

<p>"How now, is there a new deal in the game?
Yesterday you did but dream; to-day you seem
awake."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tristram had changed his armor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
now was attired all in black.</p>

<p>"You have more fight in you than you had
yesterday, that is sure," said Dinadan. "Did I stir
up your sleeping spirit?"</p>

<p>"It may be so," said Tristram, smiling. "Keep
well up to me, and I shall make you a highway
through the press. If you see me overmatched,
do what you can to aid me."</p>

<p>When ready they took their horses and rode back
to the lists, where Isolde and Palamides noted their
entrance. When the Saracen saw that Tristram
was disguised, a new fancy came into his scheming
brain. Leaving the lists, he rode to where a knight
sat sorely wounded under a tree outside. Him
he prayed for an exchange of armor, saying that
his own was too well known in the field, and that
he wished for a disguise.</p>

<p>"That is very true," said the knight, as he recognized
the green armor. "You have made your
array somewhat too well known. You are welcome
to my arms, if they will be of use to you. They
will gain more credit in your hands than they
have won in mine."</p>

<p>Palamides thereupon exchanged armor with
him, and, taking his shield, which shone like silver,
rode into the field. He now joined the party of
King Arthur, and rode spitefully against Tristram,
who had just struck down three knights. They
met with such force that both spears splintered to
their hands, though neither lost his seat. Then
they dashed eagerly together with drawn swords
and fought with the courage and fury of two lions.
But Tristram wondered much what knight this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
was that faced him so valiantly, and grew angry
as he felt that he was wasting in this single combat
the strength he wished to treasure up for the day's
work.</p>

<p>La Belle Isolde, who had watched Palamides
from her window, had seen him change his armor
with the wounded knight. And when his treacherous
purpose came to her mind she wept so heartily
and was so deeply disturbed that she swooned away.</p>

<p>At this juncture in the fray Lancelot rode again
into the field, and when the knights of Arthur's
party saw him the cry went up. "Return, return,
here comes Sir Lancelot du Lake!"</p>

<p>And some said to him, "Sir Lancelot, yonder
knight in the black harness is your man. He is
the best of our opponents, and has nearly overcome
the good knight with the silver shield."</p>

<p>At this Lancelot rode between the combatants,
and cried to Palamides,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let me have this battle; you need repose."</p>

<p>Palamides knew Lancelot, and readily gave way,
hoping through his mighty aid to gain revenge
upon his rival. Then Lancelot fell upon Tristram,
and, unknowing who he was, dealt him blows that
would have stunned a less hardy fighter. Tristram
returned them but feebly, for he knew well
with whom he fought. And Isolde, who saw it
all, was half out of her mind with grief.</p>

<p>Dinadan now told Gareth who the knight in
black armor was, and said, "Lancelot will get the
better of him, for one is weary and the other fresh,
and Tristram is not fighting with his old vim.
Let us to his aid."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>"I am with you," said Gareth. "Yonder fellow
with the silver shield is waiting to fall on Tristram,
if he can to advantage. It is our business to give
our friend what help we can."</p>

<p>Then they rode in, and Gareth struck Lancelot
a sword-blow that made his head swim, while Dinadan
followed with a spear-thrust that bore horse
and man together to the earth.</p>

<p>"Why do you this?" cried Tristram, angrily.
"It is not a knightly act, and does not that good
knight any dishonor. I was quite his match without
you."</p>

<p>Then Palamides came to Lancelot's aid, and a
close medley of fighting began, in which Dinadan
was unhorsed and Tristram pulled Palamides from
his saddle, and fell with him. Dinadan now sprang
up and caught Tristram's horse by the bridle, calling
out, with purpose to end the fight,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord Sir Tristram, take your horse."</p>

<p>"What is this?" cried Lancelot. "What have
I done? Sir Tristram, why came you here disguised?
Surely I would not have drawn sword
on you, had I known you."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Tristram, "this is not the first honor
you have done me."</p>

<p>Then they mounted their horses again, while
the people on one side gave Lancelot the honor
of the fray, and those on the other side gave it to
Tristram.</p>

<p>"The honor is not mine," said Lancelot. "He
has been longer in the field, and has smitten down
many more knights; so I give my voice for Sir
Tristram, and pray to all my lords and fellows to
do the same."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>This was the verdict of the judges, and the prize
of that day's tourney was by all voted to the noble
Sir Tristram.</p>

<p>Then the trumpets blew to lodging, and the
knights left the field, while Queen Isolde was conducted
to her pavilion. But her heart burned hot
with wrath against Palamides, all whose treachery
she had seen. As Tristram rode forward with
Gareth and Dinadan, Palamides joined them, still
disguised.</p>

<p>"Sir knight," said Tristram, "you are not of
our party, and your company is not welcome. So
begone."</p>

<p>"Not I," he answered. "One of the best knights
in the world bade me keep fellowship with you,
and till he relieve me from that service I must obey
him."</p>

<p>"Ha, Palamides, I know you now!" said Tristram.
"But, by my faith, I did not know you before,
for I deemed you a worthy knight and not a
traitor. I could have handled you well enough,
but you brought Lancelot to your aid against me."</p>

<p>"Are you my lord, Sir Tristram?" said Palamides,
in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>"That you know, well enough."</p>

<p>"How should I know it any more than you knew
me? I deemed you the king of Ireland, for you
bear his arms."</p>

<p>"I won them in battle, from his champion Sir
Marhaus," said Tristram.</p>

<p>"Sir," answered Palamides, "I fancied you had
joined Lancelot's party, and that caused me to turn
to the same side."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>"If that be so, I forgive you," said Tristram.</p>

<p>But when they reached the pavilion and had disarmed
and washed, and were come to table, Isolde
grew red with wrath on seeing Palamides.</p>

<p>"You traitor and felon!" she cried, "how dare
you thrust yourself into this goodly company? You
know not how falsely he has treated you, my lord
Tristram. I saw it all. He watched you when you
rode to your tent and donned the black armor.
Then he changed armor with a wounded knight and
rode back and wilfully changed sides, and drew
sword upon you. I saw it all, my lord, and I
impeach him of treason."</p>

<p>"Madam," said Palamides, calmly, "you may
say what you will. I cannot in courtesy deny you.
Yet by my knighthood I declare I knew not Sir
Tristram."</p>

<p>"I will take your excuse," said Tristram,
"though it seems a lame one. You spared me little
in the field, but all that I have pardoned."</p>

<p>At this, Isolde held down her head in despite
and said no more.</p>

<p>While they were still at table two knights rode
to the pavilions, and entered in full armor.</p>

<p>"Fair sirs," said Tristram, "is this courtesy, to
come upon us thus armed at our meal?"</p>

<p>"We come with no ill intent," said one, "but as
your friends, Sir Tristram."</p>

<p>"I am come," said the other, "to greet you as a
friend and comrade, and my companion is eager
to see and welcome La Belle Isolde."</p>

<p>"Then remove your helms, that I may see what
guests I have."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>"That we do, willingly."</p>

<p>No sooner were their helmets off than Tristram
sprang hastily to his feet.</p>

<p>"Madam, arise," he cried; "this is none less
than my lord King Arthur; and this my very dear
friend Sir Lancelot."</p>

<p>Then the king and queen kissed, and Lancelot
and Tristram warmly embraced, while deep joy
filled all hearts there. At the request of Isolde the
visitors removed their armor and joined them at
their meal.</p>

<p>"Many is the day that I have longed to see you,"
said Arthur to Isolde, "for much praise have I
heard of you, and not without warrant. For a
nobler match for beauty and valor than you and
Sir Tristram the world does not hold."</p>

<p>"We thank you heartily," replied Tristram and
Isolde. "Such praise from King Arthur is the
highest honor that men's lips could give."</p>

<p>Then they talked of other things, but mainly of
the tournament.</p>

<p>"Why were you against us?" asked Arthur.
"You are a Knight of the Round Table, and have
fought to-day against your own."</p>

<p>"Here is Dinadan, and your own nephew Gareth.
You must blame them for that," said Tristram,
smiling.</p>

<p>"You may lay all the blame on my shoulders,
if Tristram wishes it," said Gareth.</p>

<p>"Not on mine, then," said Dinadan. "Mine
are only broad enough to carry my own sins. It
was this unhappy Tristram brought us to the tournament,
and I owe to him a whole body full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
aches and pains as it is, without taking any of his
sins in my sack, to boot."</p>

<p>At this the king and Lancelot laughed heartily,
and the more so at the sour grimace with which
Dinadan ended.</p>

<p>"What knight was he with the shield of silver
that held you so short?" asked Arthur.</p>

<p>"Here he sits," said Tristram.</p>

<p>"What! was it Palamides?"</p>

<p>"None less than he," said Isolde.</p>

<p>"That was not a courteous action."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Palamides, "Tristram was so disguised
that I knew him not."</p>

<p>"That may well be," said Lancelot, "for I knew
him no better."</p>

<p>"However it be, we are friends again," said
Tristram, "and I hope will continue so."</p>

<p>And so the evening passed, till the time came
for Arthur and Lancelot to take their leave.</p>

<p>That night Palamides slept not for the pain
and envy that burned in his heart. But when his
friends entered his chamber in the morning they
found him fast asleep, with his cheeks stained with
tears.</p>

<p>"Say nothing," said Tristram. "The poor fellow
has been deeply wounded by the rebuke that
I and Isolde gave him. Lay no heavier load upon
his heart."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h4>THE WOES OF TWO LOVERS.</h4>


<p>Early on the third morning of the tournament
the knights of Tristram's party were up and armed,
they now being all arrayed in red, as was also
Isolde and her maidens. And rare was the show
they made as they rode gayly to the priory, where
they left Isolde and her maidens to occupy their
proper seats. As the knights turned thence towards
the field they heard three loud bugle-blasts, and saw
the throng of armed knights press eagerly forward,
while already from the listed space came the thunder
of hoofs and the cries of combatants.</p>

<p>Into the field they rode, Palamides in advance,
and such havoc did he make in the opposing ranks
that shouts of approval went up from all the seats.
But Tristram now rode forward at the full speed
of his great war-horse, hurled Kay the seneschal
from his saddle, smote down three other knights
with the same spear, and then, drawing his sword,
laid about him like a roused giant.</p>

<p>Quickly changed the cry from Palamides. "O
Tristram! O Tristram!" shouted the throng of
spectators, and the deeds of this new champion
threw those of the former victor into the shade.</p>

<p>Gareth and Dinadan also nobly aided the two
champions, rousing the admiration of Arthur and
Lancelot by their gallantry, and the four knightly
comrades soon cleared a wide space in the ranks
before them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>"Come," said Arthur, "we must to the rescue,
or our side will be driven from the field before the
day is an hour old. See how the others crowd in on
Tristram's steps, like wolves to the prey."</p>

<p>Then he and Lancelot hastily armed and sought
the field, where they quickly fought their way into
the thickest press of the tumult. Tristram, not
knowing them, rode upon them and thrust King
Arthur from his horse, and when Lancelot rushed
to his rescue he was surrounded with such an eager
host that he was pulled from his saddle to the
ground.</p>

<p>Seeing this, the kings of Ireland and Scotland,
with their knights, rushed forward to take Lancelot
and Arthur prisoners. But they counted without
their host, for the dismounted knights laid about
them like angry lions, driving back all who came
near them. Of all that passed in that hot turmoil
it were too much to say. Many a knight there did
deeds of great prowess, and Arthur and Lancelot
being mounted again, strewed the earth with fallen
knights, Lancelot that day unhorsing thirty warriors.
Yet the other side held so firmly together
that, with all their ardent labor, Arthur and his
party were overmatched.</p>

<p>At this juncture, Tristram turned to his companions
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My good comrades, I begin to fancy that we are
to-day on the wrong side. King Arthur's party is
overborne more by numbers than valor, for I must
say I never saw so few men do so well. It would
be a shame for us, who are Knights of the Round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Table, to see our lord Arthur and our good comrade
Lancelot dishonored. I am in the humor to
change sides, and help our king and liege lord."</p>

<p>"We are with you in that," cried Gareth and
Dinadan. "We have been fighting against the
grain these three days."</p>

<p>"Do as you will," said Palamides. "I shall not
change my hand in the midst of the fray."</p>

<p>"As you will," said Tristram. "You are your
own master. Speed well in your way, and we will
do our best in ours."</p>

<p>Then he, Gareth, and Dinadan drew out of the
press and rode round to Arthur's side, where they
lent such noble aid that the fortune of the field
quickly changed, and the opposing party began to
give ground. As for Palamides, King Arthur
struck him so fierce a blow that he was hurled from
his horse, while Tristram and Lancelot unhorsed
all before them. Such havoc did they make, indeed,
that the party of the opposing kings was soon in
full flight from the field, bearing Palamides, who
wept for rage and grief, with them.</p>

<p>Then rarely sounded the trumpets, and loudly
shouted the spectators, while the names of Tristram
and Lancelot were in every mouth, some voting
one the prize, some the other. But neither of these
good comrades would have it alone, so that in the
end it was divided between them.</p>

<p>When evening drew near, and the knights had
all withdrawn to their pavilions, Palamides rode
up to that of Sir Tristram, in company with the
kings of Wales and Scotland. Here he drew up
his horse, praying his companions to wait a while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
while he spoke to the knight within. Then he cried
loudly at the entrance,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where are you, Tristram of Lyonesse?"</p>

<p>"Is that you, Palamides?" answered the knight.
"Will you not dismount and join us?"</p>

<p>"I seek better company, sir traitor," cried Palamides,
in tones that trembled with fury. "I hate
you now as much as I once esteemed you, and bear
this in mind, if it were daylight as it is night,
I would slay you with my own hands. You shall
die yet for this day's deeds."</p>

<p>"You blame me wrongly, Palamides," said Tristram,
mildly. "If you had done as I advised you
would have won honor instead of disgrace. Why
come you here seeking to lay your own fault on
me? Since you give me such broad warning, I
shall be well on my guard against you."</p>

<p>"Well you may, sir dastard, for I love you not,"
and, fiercely spurring his horse, the hot-blooded
Saracen joined his kingly companions.</p>

<p>When the next day dawned the festive array
which had long spread bustle and splendor round
Lonazep broke up, and knights and ladies rode
off in all directions through the land, to carry far
and wide the story of the wondrous deeds of valor
that had been performed at the great tournament.
Tristram and his two comrades, with Hector de
Maris and Bleoberis, escorted La Belle Isolde to
Joyous Gard, where for seven days the guests were
nobly entertained, with all the sports and mirthfulness
that could be devised. King Arthur and
his knights drew back to Camelot, and Palamides
rode onward with the two kings, his heart torn with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
mingled sorrow and despair. Not alone was he
in grief for his disgrace in the field, under the
eyes of her he loved, but was full as sorrowful
for the hot words he had spoken in his wrath to
Tristram, who had been so kind and gentle to him
that his heart was torn to think how falsely and
treacherously he had requited him.</p>

<p>His kingly companions would have had him stay
with them, but he could not be persuaded, so the
king of Ireland presented him with a noble courser,
and the king of Scotland with valuable gifts, and
he rode his way, still plunged in a grief that was
almost despair. Noon brought him to a forest
fountain, beside which lay a wounded knight, who
sighed so mournfully that the very leaves on the
trees seemed to sigh in echo.</p>

<p>"Why mourn you so, fair knight?" asked Palamides,
mildly. "Or if you care not to tell, at least
let me lie beside you and join my moans to yours,
for I dare say I have a hundredfold deeper cause
for grief, and we may ease our hearts by mutual
complaints."</p>

<p>"What is your name, gentle sir?"</p>

<p>"Such as I am, for better or worse, men call
me Palamides, son to King Astlabor."</p>

<p>"Noble sir, it solaces me much to meet you. I
am Epinegris, son to the king of Northumberland.
Now repose you on this mossy bank and let us tell
our woes, and so ease somewhat our sad hearts."</p>

<p>Then Palamides dismounted and laid himself beside
the wounded knight.</p>

<p>"This is my source of woe," he said. "I love
the fairest queen that ever drew breath, La Belle
Isolde, Cornwall's queen."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>"That is sheer folly," said Epinegris, "for she
loves none but Tristram de Lyonesse."</p>

<p>"Know I it not? I have been in their company
this month, daily reaping sorrow. And now I
have lost the fellowship of Tristram and the love
of Isolde forever, through my envy and jealousy,
and never more shall a glad thought enter my
sorrowful heart."</p>

<p>"Did she ever show you signs of love?"</p>

<p>"Never. She hated me, I fear. And the last
day we met she gave me such a rebuke that I will
never recover from it:&mdash;yet well I deserved it by
my unknightly acts. Many great deeds have I
done for her love, yet never shall I win a smile
from her eyes."</p>

<p>"Deep is your grief, indeed," said Epinegris,
with a heart-breaking sigh, "yet it is but a jest
to my sorrow. For my lady loved me, and I won
her with my hands. But, alas! this day I have
lost her and am left here to moan. I took her
from an earl and two knights that were with her;
but as we sat here this day, telling each other of
our loves, there came an errant knight, named
Helior de Preuse, and challenged me to fight for my
lady. You see what followed. He wounded me
so that he left me for dead and took my lady with
him. So my sorrow is deepest, for I have rejoiced
in my love, and you never have. To have and lose
is far worse than never to own."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Palamides. "But yet I
have the deepest cause for grief, for your love is
not hopeless, like mine. And I shall prove this,
for if I can find this Helior he shall be made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
yield you your lady, unless he prove able to deal
with me as he has with you."</p>

<p>Then he helped Epinegris on his horse and led
him to a hermitage near by, where he left him
under the care of the holy hermit. Here Palamides
stayed not long, but walked out under the
shadow of the green leaves, to be a while alone
with his woes. But not far had he gone before
he saw near him a knight, who bore a shield that
he had seen Hector de Maris wear. With him were
ten other knights, who sheltered themselves from
the noontide heat under the green leaves.</p>

<p>As they stood there another knight came by
whose shield was green, with a white lion in its
midst, and who led a lady on a palfrey. As he
came up, the knight who bore Sir Hector's shield
rode fiercely after him, and bade him turn and
defend his lady.</p>

<p>"That I must, in knightly duty," cried the other.</p>

<p>Then the two knights rode together with such
might that horses and men together were hurled
to the earth. Drawing their swords, they now
fought sturdily for the space of an hour. In the
end the knight of the white lion was stricken to
the earth and forced to beg for his life.</p>

<p>Palamides stood under the leaves, watching this
combat till it came to its end. Then he went to
the lady, whom he believed to be her whom he
had promised to rescue. Taking her gently by the
hand, he asked her if she knew a knight named
Epinegris.</p>

<p>"Alas! that ever I did," she sadly replied.
"For his sake I have lost my liberty, and for mine
he has lost his life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>"Not so badly as that," said Palamides. "He
is at yonder hermitage. I will take you to him."</p>

<p>"Then he lives!" she cried in joy. "You fill
my heart with gladness."</p>

<p>But not many steps had Palamides led her before
the victorious knight cried out in tones of fierce
anger,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Loose the lady, sirrah! Whither take you
her?"</p>

<p>"Whither I will?" answered Palamides.</p>

<p>"You speak largely, sir knave," cried the knight.
"Do you fancy you can rob me of my prize so
lightly? Think it not, sirrah; were you as good
a knight as Lancelot or Tristram or Palamides,
you should not have that lady without winning
her at a dearer rate than I did."</p>

<p>"If fight it is, I am ready for you," answered
Palamides. "I promised to bring this lady to her
lover from whom yonder knight stole her, and it
will need more swords than one to make me break
my word."</p>

<p>"We shall see if that be so," said the other,
attacking him so fiercely that Palamides had much
ado to protect himself. They fought for so long
a time that Palamides marvelled much who this
knight could be that withstood him so sturdily
after his late hard battle.</p>

<p>"Knight," he said, at length, "you fight like
a hero. I would know your name."</p>

<p>"You shall have it for yours in return."</p>

<p>"I agree to that."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, my name is Safere. I am son of
King Astlobar, and brother to Palamides and Segwarides."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>"Then heaven defend me for having fought you,
for I am your brother Palamides."</p>

<p>At these words Safere fell upon his knees and
begged his brother's pardon; and then they unlaced
their helms and kissed each other with tears of joy.</p>

<p>As they stood thus, Epinegris advanced towards
them, for he had heard the sounds of fighting, and,
wounded as he was, he came to help Palamides if
he should stand in need.</p>

<p>Palamides, seeing him approach, took the lady
by the hand and led her to him, and they embraced
so tenderly that all hearts there were touched.</p>

<p>"Fair knight and lady," said Safere, "it would
be a cruel pity to part you, and I pray heaven to
send you joy of each other."</p>

<p>"You have my sincere thanks," said Epinegris.
"And deeper thanks has Sir Palamides for what
he has done for me this day. My castle is near by;
will you not ride there with me as a safeguard?"</p>

<p>"That we gladly will," they said, and when
Epinegris had got his horse they rode with him
and the lady to the castle, where they were nobly
received and treated with the highest honor. They
had such good cheer and such enjoyment as they had
rarely before known. And never burned the flame
of love more warmly than that between Epinegris
and his rescued lady.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h4>THE RIVALRY OF TRISTRAM AND PALAMIDES.</h4>


<p>When morning again dawned over the forest
and the smiling fields that surrounded the castle
of Epinegris, the two brothers rode out, taking
with them the blessings and prayers for good fortune
of those they left behind. But had they known
into what deadly peril they ventured they would
not for days have left those hospitable gates.</p>

<p>For they rode on hour by hour, until afternoon
came, and then found themselves in front of a
noble manor-house from which came to their ears
doleful sounds of woe and lamentation.</p>

<p>"What means this woful noise? Shall we enter
and see?" said Safere.</p>

<p>"Willingly," answered Palamides.</p>

<p>Leaving their horses at the gates, they entered
the court-yard, where they saw an old man tremblingly
fumbling his beads. But when they came
within the hall they beheld many men weeping
and lamenting.</p>

<p>"Fair sirs, why make you such a moaning?"
asked Palamides.</p>

<p>"We weep for our lord, who is slain," they dolefully
replied.</p>

<p>But one of the knights observed the new-comers
closely, and said secretly to his fellows,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Know you not this man? Fortune has thrown
into our hands the knight who slew our lord at
Lonazep. That tall fellow is Palamides. Let him
not go as easily as he came."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>Hearing this, most of them quietly withdrew
and armed themselves, and then came suddenly
upon their visitors to the number of threescore,
crying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Defend yourself, if you can, Sir Palamides.
We know you for the murderer of our lord, and
it is our duty to revenge him. Die you shall,
though you had the might of a giant."</p>

<p>Palamides and his brother, finding themselves
in this desperate strait, set themselves back to
back in the midst of their assailants, and fought
like very giants, keeping their ground for two
hours, though they were attacked by twenty knights
and forty gentlemen and yeomen. But strength
cannot hold out forever against odds, and at the
end they were forced to yield, and were locked up
in a strong prison.</p>

<p>Within three days thereafter a court of twelve
knights sat upon the charge against them, and
found Sir Palamides guilty of their lord's death.</p>

<p>Sir Safere, who was adjudged not guilty, was
given his liberty, and bidden to depart from the
castle. He parted with his brother in the deepest
woe.</p>

<p>"Dear brother, grieve not so greatly," said Palamides.
"If die I must, I shall meet death
bravely. But had I dreamed of such a doom as this,
they should never have taken me alive."</p>

<span class="caption">THE DEPARTURE.</span>
</div>

<p>Then Safere departed in untold sorrow, though
not without hope of rescue if he could raise a force
to storm the castle. This he had no chance to do,
for on the next morning Palamides was sent under
an escort of twelve knights to the father of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
dead knight, who dwelt in a strong castle by the
sea-side, named Pelownes, where it had been decided
that the sentence should be put into execution.</p>

<p>Palamides was placed on a sorry old steed with
his feet bound beneath it, and, surrounded by the
guard of twelve armed knights, was taken towards
the place of death.</p>

<p>But through the favor of fortune their route lay
by the castle of Joyous Gard, and here they were
seen by one who knew Palamides, and who asked
him whither he was borne.</p>

<p>"To my death," he answered, "for the slaying
of a knight at the tournament. Had I not left
Sir Tristram this would not have happened to me.
I pray you, recommended me to your lord and to
my lady Isolde, and beg them to forgive me my
trespasses against them. And also to my lord King
Arthur, and to all my fellows of the Round Table."</p>

<p>When the yeoman heard this he rode in all haste
to Joyous Gard, where he told Tristram of what he
had seen and heard.</p>

<p>"To his death, you say?" cried Tristram. "And
for an accident of the tournament? Why, I and
twenty others might be served in the same manner.
I have reason to be angry with Palamides, but he
shall not die the death of a dog if I can rescue him."</p>

<p>This said, he armed in all haste, and taking two
squires with him, he rode at a fast gallop towards
the castle of Pelownes, hoping to overtake the
party before they could pass its gates.</p>

<p>But fortune had decreed that the prisoner should
be otherwise rescued. For as the guard of knights
rode on their way they passed by a well where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Lancelot had alighted to drink of the refreshing
waters.</p>

<p>When he saw the cavalcade approach he put on
his helmet and stood watching them as they passed.
But his heart swelled with anger when he saw Palamides
disarmed and bound in their midst, and
seemingly led to his death.</p>

<p>"What means this?" he cried. "What has this
knight done that deserves a shameful death?
Whatever it be, I cannot suffer him to be foully
dealt with."</p>

<p>Then he mounted and rode after the twelve
knights, soon overtaking them.</p>

<p>"Sir knights," he said, "whither take you that
gentleman? To ride thus bound is not befitting
for a man of his metal."</p>

<p>At this the guard of knights turned their horses
and faced Lancelot.</p>

<p>"We counsel you not to meddle with us," they
said, sternly. "This man has deserved death, and
to death he is adjudged."</p>

<p>"I tell you, sirs, it shall not be. He is too good
a knight to die a shameful death. Defend yourselves,
then, for I will try my one hand against
your twelve, and rescue him or die in the effort."</p>

<p>The knights of the guard now put their spears
in rest, and Lancelot rode upon them with such
fury that the foremost and three of those behind
him were hurled to the ground before his spear
broke. Then he drew his sword and laid about
him so shrewdly that in a little time the whole
twelve of them were stretched upon the earth, most
of them being sorely wounded. Lancelot now cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the bonds of Palamides, mounted him upon the
best of their horses, and rode back with him towards
Joyous Gard.</p>

<p>As they went forward they saw Sir Tristram
approaching. Lancelot knew him at sight, but was
himself unknown, because he bore a golden shield
which neither Tristram nor Palamides recognized.
He therefore mystified them for a time, and declined
to enter Joyous Gard on the plea that he had
other pressing business on hand. But when
strongly entreated, he at length consented, and
entered the castle with them.</p>

<p>Great was their surprise and joy when he had
unhelmed, to find that they had their host for
guest. Tristram took him in his arms, and so did
Isolde, while Palamides kneeled before him and
thanked him for his life. When Lancelot saw this
he took him by the hand and made him rise.</p>

<p>"Good sirs," he said, "could I, or any knight
of worship in this land, hesitate to rescue from an
ignoble death such a knight as Palamides? Had
there been fifty instead of twelve, I fear I should
have braved them all."</p>

<p>Much joy was there in Joyous Gard at the visit
of the lord of the castle, but Lancelot stayed there
but four days. Palamides, however, remained for
two months and more, his love and grief growing
deeper, till he faded away to a shadow of himself.</p>

<p>One day, at the end of this time, he wandered
far into the neighboring forest, and here by chance
saw the reflection of his face in a clear pool. The
wasted visage disturbed and affrighted him.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" he asked himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
"Am I, who was called one of the handsomest
knights in the world, wasted to such a frightful
figure? I must leave this life, for it is idle to
grieve myself to death for that which I can never
possess."</p>

<p>Then he threw himself beside the well, and from
the fulness of his heart began to make a song about
La Belle Isolde and himself, a rhyme made up of
music, love, and grief.</p>

<p>As chance would have it, Tristram had ridden
into the forest that day in chase of the hart. And
as he rode up and down under the green leaves the
summer air brought to his ears the sound of a
voice singing loud and clear. He rode softly
towards the sound, for he deemed that some knight-errant
lay there solacing himself with song.</p>

<p>When he came nigh he tied his horse to a tree
and advanced on foot. Then he became aware that
the singer was his guest Palamides, and that his
song was about La Belle Isolde, a doleful and
piteous, yet marvellously well-made song, which
the singer sang loudly and in a clear voice. Tristram
stood listening till he had heard it from
beginning to end. But at the last his anger grew
so high that he needed to restrain himself from
slaying the singer where he lay.</p>

<p>Remembering that Palamides was unarmed, he
resisted this impulse, and advanced slowly towards
him.</p>

<p>"Sir Palamides," he said, in a gentle voice, "I
have heard your song, and learned your treason
to your host. If it were not for the shame of an
unknightly act I would deal you here the meed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
you have earned. How will you acquit yourself of
treachery?"</p>

<p>"Thus will I," said Palamides, springing to his
feet in his surprise. "As for Queen Isolde, you
may know well that I love her above all other
ladies in the world. I loved her before you ever saw
her, as you know, and have never ceased nor shall
ever cease to love her. What honor I have won
is due for the most part to my love of her. Yet
never for a moment has she returned my love, and
I have been her knight without guerdon. Therefore
I dread not death, for I had as lief die as live."</p>

<p>"Well have you uttered your treason," said
Tristram.</p>

<p>"No treason is it," said Palamides. "Love is
free to all men, and I have a right to love any
lady I will. If she return it not, no man is harmed.
Such wrong as is done I have suffered, not you,
for your love is returned and mine has brought
me but pain. Yet I shall continue to love La
Belle Isolde to the end of my days as deeply as
you can."</p>

<p>That there was reason in these words Tristram
could not but have seen, had not anger blinded
his wisdom.</p>

<p>"None shall love my lady but myself," he cried,
in passion. "And for what you have said I challenge
you to battle to the uttermost."</p>

<p>"I can never fight in a better quarrel," said
Palamides. "And if you slay me I can never die
by a nobler hand. Since I cannot hope for favor
from La Belle Isolde, I have as good will to die as
to live."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>"Then set a day in which we shall do battle in
this cause."</p>

<p>"Let it be fifteen days hence. And let the place
be in the meadow under Joyous Gard."</p>

<p>"Why so long a time?" demanded Tristram.
"To-morrow will suit me better."</p>

<p>"It is because I am meagre and weak, and have
fallen away to a shadow through hopeless love.
I must rest until I get my strength again before I
can face so doughty a knight."</p>

<p>"So let it be, then," said Tristram. "Yet once
before you broke a promise to meet me in battle
at the grave near Camelot."</p>

<p>"What could I do?" rejoined Palamides. "I
was in prison, and could not keep my word."</p>

<p>"If you had done so, there would have been no
need of a fight now," said Tristram, as he strode
haughtily away.</p>

<p>Then Palamides took his horse and rode to
Arthur's court, where he did his utmost to rest
and regain strength. When the appointed time
approached he returned, attended by four knights
and four sergeant-at-arms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tristram spent his time at the chase.
And by evil fortune, about three days before the
time of battle, a wild arrow shot by an archer at
a hart struck him in the thigh and wounded him
so deeply that he could scarcely return to Joyous
Gard.</p>

<p>Great was his heaviness of heart, and neither
man nor woman could bring him cheer, for it was
now impossible to keep his word with his rival;
and his heart grew full of the fancy that Palamides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
himself had shot that arrow, so as to prevent
him doing battle on the appointed day. But
this no knight about Tristram would believe.</p>

<p>When the fifteenth day came Palamides appeared
at the place fixed, with the knights and
sergeants whom he had brought with him to bear
record of the battle. One sergeant bore his helm,
a second his spear, and a third his shield. And
for two hours he rested in the field, awaiting the
approach of his antagonist.</p>

<p>Then, seeing that Tristram failed to come, he
sent a squire to Joyous Gard to remind him of his
challenge. When Tristram heard of this message
he had the squire brought to his chamber, and
showed him his wound.</p>

<p>"Tell Sir Palamides," he said, "that were I able
to come he would not need to send for me, and
that I had rather be whole to-day than have all
King Arthur's gold. Tell him, moreover, that as
soon as I am able I shall seek him throughout the
land, as I am a true knight; and when I find him
he shall have his fill of battle."</p>

<p>This message the squire brought to his master,
who heard it with much secret satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I would have had hard handling of him, and
very likely have been vanquished," he said, "for
he has not his equal in battle, unless it be Sir
Lancelot. So I am well content to give up the
fight."</p>

<p>A month passed before Tristram was well. Then
he took his horse and rode from country to country
in search of Palamides, having many strange adventures
by the way, but nowhere could he meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
or hear of his rival in love. But during his search
Tristram did so many valiant deeds that his fame
for the time quite overtopped that of Lancelot, so
much so that Lancelot's kinsmen in their anger
would have waylaid and slain the valiant warrior.</p>

<p>For this jealousy Lancelot sternly rebuked them,
saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bear it well in mind, that if any of you does
any harm to Sir Tristram, that man shall I slay
with my own hands. To murder a man like this
for his noble deeds! Out upon such base designs!
Far rather should you worship him for his valor
and royal prowess."</p>

<p>And so time went on for the space of two years,
during which Tristram sought in vain for his
rival.</p>

<p>At the end of that time he came home to Joyous
Gard from one of his journeys of adventure, and
there was told by La Belle Isolde of a great feast
to be held at the court on the coming day of Pentecost,
which she counselled him strongly to attend.</p>

<p>Much debate passed between him and his lady-love
on this subject, for he was loth to go without
her, and she cared not to go. In the end he declared
that he would obey her wishes, but would
ride thither unarmed, save for his sword and spear.</p>

<p>This he did, and though she in her loving anxiety
sent after him four knights, he sent them back
within half a mile. Yet he soon had reason to
repent his rashness. For hardly had he gone a
mile farther when he came upon a wounded knight,
who told him he owed his hurt to Sir Palamides.
What to do now, Tristram knew not. Near by was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the foe he had so long sought in vain, and he was
unarmed. Should he ride back for his armor, or
go on as he was?</p>

<p>While he stood thinking, Palamides appeared,
and knew him at sight.</p>

<p>"Well met, Sir Tristram!" he cried. "I have
heard much of your search for me. You have found
me now, and we shall not part till we have settled
our old scores."</p>

<p>"As for that," answered Tristram, "no Christian
can boast that I ever fled from him, nor shall
a Saracen make this boast, even if I be unarmed."</p>

<p>Then he put his horse to the gallop and rode on
Palamides with such fury that his spear broke
into a hundred pieces. Throwing it away, he drew
his sword and struck Palamides six great strokes
upon the helm, while the Saracen stood unresisting,
and wondering at the folly and madness of his foe.
Then Tristram cried out in fury,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Coward knight, why stand you thus idly? You
dare not do battle with me, for doubt not but I can
endure all your strength and malice."</p>

<p>"You know well, Sir Tristram," answered Palamides,
"that I cannot in honor strike at your unarmed
head. If I should slay you thus, shame
would be my lot. As for your valor and hardiness,
those I shall never question."</p>

<p>"You speak well," answered Tristram.</p>

<p>"Tell me this," continued Palamides. "Were
I here naked of armor, and you full armed as I
am, what would you do?"</p>

<p>"I shall not answer from fear, but from truthfulness.
I would bid you depart, as I could not
have ado with you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>"No more can I with you," said Palamides,
"therefore ride on your way."</p>

<p>"I shall ride or abide as I may choose," said
Tristram. "But tell me this, Palamides: how
is it that so good a knight as you refuses to be
christened, as your brothers have long been?"</p>

<p>"I cannot become a Christian till a vow I made
years ago is fulfilled. I believe fully in Jesus
Christ and His mild mother Mary; but there is
one battle yet I must fight, and when that is done
I will be baptized with a good will."</p>

<p>"If that is the battle with me," said Tristram,
"you shall not long wait for it. For God defend
that through my fault you should continue a Saracen.
Yonder is a knight whom you have hurt.
Help me to put on his armor and I will aid you to
fulfil your vow."</p>

<p>So they rode together to the wounded knight,
who was seated on a bank. Tristram saluted him,
and he weakly returned the salute.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me your name, sir knight?"
asked Tristram.</p>

<p>"I am Sir Galleron of Galway, and a Knight
of the Round Table."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for your hurts, and beg you to lend
me your armor, for I am unarmed, and would do
battle with this knight who wounded you."</p>

<p>"You shall have it with a good will. But you
must beware, for this is no common knight."</p>

<p>"I know him well," answered Tristram, "and
have an old quarrel with him."</p>

<p>"Will you kindly tell me your name?"</p>

<p>"My name is Tristram de Lyonesse."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>"Then it was idle to warn you. Well I know
your renown and worship; and Sir Palamides is
likely to have no light task."</p>

<p>Tristram now took off the armor of the wounded
knight, who, as well as he could, helped him to
put it on himself. This accomplished, Tristram
mounted his horse and took in his hand Sir Galleron's
spear.</p>

<p>Riding to where Palamides stood waiting, he
bade him make ready. In a minute more the two
strong knights came hurtling together like two
lions. Each smote the other in the centre of the
shield, but Palamides's spear broke, while that of
Tristram overturned the horse of Palamides. In
a moment the unhorsed knight had sprung to his
feet and drawn his sword, while Tristram alighted,
tied his horse to a tree, and advanced to the fray.</p>

<p>The combat that succeeded was a hard and well-fought
one, as only it could be between two such
knights. For more than two hours it continued,
Tristram often bringing Palamides to his knees by
his mighty strokes, while Palamides cut through
Tristram's shield and wounded him. Then, in a
fury of anger, Tristram rushed upon his rival and
hurled him to the earth. But in an instant the
agile Saracen was on his feet again, fighting with
all his old strength and skill. And so the combat
went on, hour by hour, and, hard as Tristram
fought, Palamides stood as nobly to his work, and
gave him stroke for stroke.</p>

<p>But, as fortune willed, in the end a fierce blow
struck the sword from Palamides's hand, nor dare
he stoop for it, for fear of being slain. So he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
stood moveless, regarding it with a sorrowful heart.</p>

<p>"Now," said Tristram, "I have you at advantage,
as you had me this day. But it shall never
be said that Tristram de Lyonesse killed a weaponless
knight. Therefore take your sword, and let
us make an end of this battle."</p>

<p>"As for that, I am willing to end it now," said
Palamides. "I have no wish to fight longer. Nor
can I think that my offence is such that we may
not be friends. All I have done is to love La Belle
Isolde. You will not say that I have done her
aught of dishonor by holding that she is peerless
among ladies, or by the valor which love for her
has given me. As for such offence as I have given
you, I have atoned for it this day, and no one can
say that I have not held my own like a man. But
this I will affirm, that I never before fought with
a man of your might. Therefore I beg you to forgive
me for all wrongs which I have done you, and
as my vow is now fulfilled, I stand ready to go
with you to the nearest church, there to be confessed,
and to receive baptism as a true and earnest
Christian knight."</p>

<p>"I gladly forgive you all you have done against
me," said Tristram; "the more so that you have
done it rather from love than from hatred. It fills
my heart with joy to be the means of bringing the
valiant Palamides into the Church of Christ, and
hereafter I shall hold you among my best friends.
Within a mile from here is the suffragan of Carlisle,
who will gladly give you the sacrament of baptism;
and all Christendom must rejoice to gain so noble
a convert."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>Then they took their horses and helped Galleron
to his, and rode to the church, where Tristram
told the suffragan the purpose of their coming.
Proud to bring into the fold of the church so notable
a convert, the suffragan filled a great vessel with
water, and hallowed it. This done, he confessed
and baptized Sir Palamides, while Tristram and
Galleron stood as his godfathers.</p>

<p>Afterwards the three knights rode to Camelot,
much to the joy of the king and queen, who gladly
welcomed Tristram to their court, and were no less
glad to learn that the valiant Palamides had become
a Christian, and that the long rivalry between
him and Tristram was at an end. The great feast
of Pentecost that followed was the merriest that
had ever been held at Arthur's court, and the merriest
that ever would be, for the breath of coming
woe and trouble was in the air, and the time was
near at hand in which that worthy fellowship of
noble knights was destined to break up in dire
disaster.</p>

<p>But first of all the tide of disaster came upon
Tristram the brave and Isolde the fair, as we must
now relate. The chronicles tell the story at length,
but the record of treachery and crime had always
best be short, and so we shall make that of King
Mark, the murderer.</p>

<p>Many years before the time to which we have
now come, King Mark's treachery had filled Cornwall
with mischief and all the land with horror,
through a deed of frightful crime. And in thus
wise it came about. Cornwall had been invaded
by a host of Saracens, but before they could do any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
mischief, Prince Baldwin, King Mark's brother,
attacked them, burned their ships, and utterly destroyed
them. Furious at heart that his brother
should win such honor, while he lay cowering with
fear in his castle, Mark invited him to Tintagil,
with his wife and child. There suddenly charging
him with treason for attacking the Saracens without
orders, he stabbed him to the heart, and would
have slain his wife and child as well had not the
lady Anglides fled for life with her child.</p>

<p>Mark sent after them an old knight named Sir
Sadok, with orders to bring them back to Tintagil.
But he suffered them to escape, and brought back
to the king a false tale that he had drowned the boy.</p>

<p>Many years now passed by, during which Baldwin's
son, Alexander the orphan, grew up to be a
youth large of limb and strong of arm. In due
time he was made a knight, whereupon Anglides
produced the bloody doublet and shirt of her murdered
husband, which she had carefully preserved,
and laid upon the young knight the duty of revenging
his father's death. The story of the crime had
been diligently kept from him, but he now accepted
this heavy charge with alacrity, and vowed solemnly
to devote his life to the duty of revenging his murdered
father.</p>

<p>News of all this was quickly brought to King
Mark, by a false knight who hoped to win favor
by turning informer.</p>

<p>"By my halidom," cried Mark, "whom can I
trust? I fancied the young viper was dead years
ago. That false hound, Sadok, let him escape. As
I am a living man, he shall pay the penalty of his
treason."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>Seizing a sword, he burst furiously from the
chamber, and rushed madly through the castle in
search of the knight who had deceived him. When
Sadok saw him coming, with fury in his face, he
guessed what had happened, and drew his own
sword in haste.</p>

<p>"King Mark," he cried, "beware how you come
nigh me. I saved the life of Alexander, and glory
in it, for you slew his father cowardly and treacherously.
And it is my hope and prayer that the
youth may have the strength and spirit to revenge
the good Prince Baldwin on his murderer."</p>

<p>"What, traitor! What, dog! Do you dare rail
thus at me?" cried the king, and in a voice of fury
he bade four knights of his following to slay the
traitor.</p>

<p>These knights drew their swords and advanced
in a body on Sadok; but he got the wall of them,
and fought so shrewdly that he killed the whole
four in King Mark's presence.</p>

<p>Then, shaking his clinched fist at the king, he
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I would add your false body to the heap, but
that I leave you for Alexander's revenge."</p>

<p>This said, he took horse and rode briskly away,
and in all his court Mark could not find a knight
willing to pursue him, for all that held with the
king feared the old knight's sturdy arm.</p>

<p>King Mark now finding his wrath of no avail,
set himself to devising some scheme of treachery
by which the danger that threatened him might be
removed. In the end he made a compact with Morgan
le Fay and the queen of Northgalis, both false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
sorceresses, in which they agreed to fill the land
with ladies that were enchantresses, and with
false knights like Malgrim and Breuse Sans Pité,
so that the young knight Alexander le Orphelin
should be surrounded with magic and treachery,
and without doubt be taken prisoner or slain.</p>

<p>Soon after his knighting, Alexander set out for
King Arthur's court, and on the way there had
many adventures, in which he proved himself a
knight of great valor and skill. Among these was
a mighty battle with the false knight Malgrim,
whom in the end he killed.</p>

<p>But now Morgan le Fay sought to entrap him
by her false devices. She gave him a sleeping
draught, and had him taken in a horse-litter to a
castle of hers named La Belle Regard.</p>

<p>Here she cured him of his wounds by healing
salves, but not until he had promised that he would
not set foot beyond the boundaries of that castle
for a twelvemonth and a day. When he had recovered,
Alexander chafed bitterly at his confinement,
for he felt sure that the pledge had been exacted
from him to save King Mark from his vow of
revenge. Yet his word held him close prisoner.</p>

<p>As one day he wandered through the halls of the
castle, like a young lion in a cage,&mdash;now heavy
and sad, now burning with desire for action,&mdash;there
came to him a damsel who was cousin to Morgan
le Fay, and to whom the castle of La Belle Regard
by right belonged.</p>

<p>"Sir knight," she said to him, "I find you doleful
of aspect; yet I bear tidings that should make
you merry!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>"I pray you tell them to me," he answered. "I
am here now a prisoner by promise, but must say
that time hangs very heavy on my hands."</p>

<p>"You are more of a prisoner than you deem,"
she replied. "My cousin, Morgan le Fay, keeps
you here for purposes of her own which you will
scarcely find to your liking."</p>

<p>"I fancy she keeps me here through an understanding
with King Mark," he rejoined. "I have
no faith in her, but I cannot break my word of
honor."</p>

<p>"Truly, fair sir," she said, "I pity your unhappy
lot, and have a plan in mind through which you
may escape from this durance without loss of
honor."</p>

<p>"Do that and I shall owe you my life's service,"
he answered, warmly. "Tell me, dear lady, by
what means I can be freed."</p>

<p>"This I may justly say, that this castle of right
belongs to me. I have been unjustly deprived of
it, and in right and honor you are my prisoner,
not Morgan's. I have an uncle who is a powerful
nobleman, the Earl of Pase, and who hates Morgan
le Fay above all persons. I shall send to him, and
pray him for my sake to destroy this castle, which
harbors only evil customs. He will come at my
wish and set fire to the building throughout. As
for you, I shall get you out at a private postern,
and there have your horse and armor ready."</p>

<p>"Truly, fair maiden, you are as wise as you are
beautiful," he answered, in eager accents. "Release
me from imprisonment to Morgan and I will
hold myself your prisoner for life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>Then she sent to her uncle the earl, and bade
him come and burn that haunt of mischief,&mdash;a
design which he already had in mind.</p>

<p>When the appointed day came the Earl of Pase
sought the castle with four hundred knights, and
set fire to it in all parts, ceasing not his efforts
till there was not a stone left standing of the once
proud stronghold.</p>

<p>But Alexander was not willing to take this as
a release from his vow, but stationed himself within
the limits of the space where had stood the castle
of La Belle Regard, and made it known far and
wide that he would hold that ground against all
comers for a twelvemonth and a day.</p>

<p>Word of this knightly challenge soon came to
Arthur's court, where was then a lady of famous
beauty and great estate, known as Alice la Belle
Pilgrim, daughter of Duke Ansirus, called the pilgrim,
since he went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem
every third year.</p>

<p>When this fair maiden heard of Alexander's
challenge, she went into the great hall of Camelot
and proclaimed in the hearing of all the knights
that whoever should overcome the champion of
La Belle Regard should wed her and be lord of
all her lands.</p>

<p>This done, she went to La Belle Regard, where
she set up her pavilion beside the piece of earth
held by the young knight. And as the weeks passed
by there came from all directions knights who had
heard of Alexander's challenge and Alice's offer,
and many a hard battle was fought. Yet from
them all Alexander came as victor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>But the more he triumphed over his knightly
foes the deeper he fell captive to his fair neighbor,
for whom he grew to feel so deep a love that it
almost robbed him of his wits. Nor was his love
unrequited, for his valor and youthful beauty had
filled her heart with as ardent a passion for him
in return, and she prayed as warmly for his victory
in every combat as though he had been her chosen
champion.</p>

<p>And so time passed on, varied by fighting and
love-making, till one day, after Alexander had unhorsed
two knights, there came to him the lady
to whom he owed the burning of the castle, who
told Alice the whole story of what had then
occurred.</p>

<p>"You worked wisely and well," answered Alice.
"Sir Alexander, indeed, has not gained much more
freedom, except it be freedom to fight. But that
is more his fault than yours."</p>

<p>"Have I not?" exclaimed the young knight.
"I have gained freedom to love also; for which I
am ever beholden to this fair damsel."</p>

<p>At this Alice turned away with a rosy blush,
while the maiden stood regarding them with merry
smiles.</p>

<p>"I have, by right, the first claim on you, Sir
Alexander," she said. "But if this fair lady wants
you, I should be sorry to stand in love's light. I
yield my claim in her favor."</p>

<p>As they thus conversed in merry mood, three
knights rode up, who challenged Alexander to joust
for the proffered prize of the hand and estate of
Alice la Belle Pilgrim. But the three of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
got such falls that they lost all desire to wed the
lady, and, like all knights whom Alexander overcame,
they were made to swear to wear no arms for
a twelvemonth and a day.</p>

<p>Yet love may bring weakness as well as strength,
as the young lover was to find to his cost. For
there came a day in which, as he stood looking
from his pavilion, he saw the lady Alice on horseback
outside, and so charming did she appear in
his eyes that his love for her became almost a
frenzy. So enamoured was he that all thought of
life and its doings fled from his brain, and he grew
like one demented.</p>

<p>While he was in this state of love-lorn blindness
the false-hearted knight Sir Mordred rode up with
purpose to joust. But when he saw that the youthful
champion was besotted with admiration of his
lady, and had no eyes or mind for aught beside, he
thought to make a jest of him, and, taking his
horse by the bridle, led him here and there, designing
to bring the lover to shame by withdrawing
him from the place he had sworn to defend.</p>

<p>When the damsel of the castle saw this, and
found that no words of hers would rouse Alexander
from his blind folly, she burned with indignation,
and bethought her of a sharper means of bringing
him back to his lost senses.</p>

<p>So she put on her armor and took a sword in her
hand, and, mounting a horse, rode upon him with
the fury of a knight, giving him such a buffet on
the helm that he thought that fire flew from his
eyes.</p>

<p>When the besotted lover felt this stroke he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
of a sudden to his wits, and felt for his sword.
But the damsel fled to the pavilion and Mordred
to the forest, so that Alexander was left raging
there, with no foe to repay for that stinging blow.</p>

<p>When he came to understand how the false knight
would have shamed him, his heart burned with
wrath that Sir Mordred had escaped his hands.
But the two ladies had many a jest upon him for
the knightly stroke which the damsel had given
him on the helm.</p>

<p>"Good faith," she said, "I knew not how else to
bring back his strayed wits. I fancy I would have
given him some shrewd work to do if I had chosen
to stand against him. These men think that none
but they can wear armor and wield swords. I took
pity on your champion, Alice, or it might have
gone hard with him," and she laughed so merrily
that they could not but join her in her mirth.</p>

<p>After that nearly every day Alexander jousted
with knights of honor and renown, but of them all
not one was able to put him to the worse, and he
held his ground to the twelvemonth's end, proving
himself a knight of the noblest prowess.</p>

<p>When the year had reached its end and his pledge
was fully kept, he departed from that place with
Alice la Belle Pilgrim, who afterwards became his
loving wife, and they lived together with great
joy and happiness in her country of Benoye.</p>

<p>But though he let love set aside for the time his
vow of revenge on King Mark, he did not forget
the duty that lay before him, nor did that evil-minded
king rest at ease under the knowledge that
an avenger was in the land. Many a false scheme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
he devised to keep Alexander from his court, and
in the end his treacherous plots proved successful,
for the young knight was murdered by some of
King Mark's emissaries, with his father's death
still unrevenged.</p>

<p>But vengeance sleeps not, and destiny had decided
that the false-hearted king should yet die in
retribution for the murder of Prince Baldwin.
Alexander left a son, who was named Bellengerus
le Beuse, and who grew up to become a valiant and
renowned knight. He it was who avenged the
slaughter of Prince Baldwin, and also of Sir Tristram,
for this noble knight was also slain by the
felonious king, as we must now tell.</p>

<p>Through the good services of King Arthur and
Queen Guenever, after Tristram and Isolde had
long dwelt at Joyous Gard, peace was made between
them and King Mark, and they returned
to Tintagil, where for a long time all went on in
seeming friendship and harmony.</p>

<p>But the false king nursed the demon of jealousy
deep within his breast, and bided his time for
revenge. At length, on a day when Tristram,
dreaming not of danger, sat harping before La
Belle Isolde, the treacherous king rushed suddenly
upon him with a naked sword in his hand and
struck him dead at her feet.</p>

<p>Retribution for this vile deed came quickly, for
Bellengerus was at Tintagil Castle at the time,
brought there by thirst of vengeance, and with a
heart filled with double fury by the news of this
dastardly deed, he rushed upon King Mark as he
stood in the midst of his knights and courtiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
and struck him to the heart with his father's
avenging blade.</p>

<p>Then, aided by Dinas, Fergus, and others of
Tristram's friends, he turned upon Andred and
the remainder of King Mark's satellites, and when
the work of blood was done not one of these false-hearted
knights remained alive, and the court of
Cornwall was purged of the villany which had long
reigned there supreme.</p>

<p>But La Belle Isolde loved Tristram with too deep
a love to survive his death, and she fell swooning
upon the cross above his tomb and there sobbed
out her life; and she was buried by his side, that
those who had been so united in life should not be
parted in death.</p>

<p>Great was the grief and pity aroused throughout
England, and through all lands where knighthood
was held in honor, by this distressful event, for
never before had two such faithful lovers breathed
mortal air. And long thereafter lovers made pilgrimages
to their tomb, where many prayed fervently
for a draught from that magic goblet from
which Tristram and Isolde drank, and whose wine
of love forever after ran so warmly in their veins.</p>

<h3>THE QUEST OF THE HOLY GRAIL.</h3>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h4>THE ENCHANTED CASTLE OF KING PELLAM.</h4>


<p>After many years had come and gone, and all
at the court of Arthur the king had grown older
and wiser, there came to pass a series of adventures
more marvellous than had ever been known
upon the earth before, and of a nobler kind than
mere tourneyings and joustings, being no less than
the quest of the holy vessel named the Sangreal,
in which was kept a portion of the blood of our
blessed Saviour, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>And through this quest much disaster came upon
the land, and the noble fellowship of the Round
Table was broken up and destroyed, for many went
in search of the holy vessel who had lived evil
lives, and of these few came back, but most of
them died deaths of violence.</p>

<p>This sacred talisman&mdash;the Sangreal&mdash;had been
brought to England centuries before by Joseph of
Arimathea, a follower of our Saviour, and had
passed down from him to his descendant, King
Pellam, of Listengeise, him whom Balin struck the
dolorous stroke, and who was destined to lie in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
misery and pain until he should be healed of his
wound by the winner of the holy vessel.</p>

<p>But to tell how this perilous quest began we must
go long years back and relate a story of strange
adventures and marvellous deliverances.</p>

<p>For it had happened that during a feast of Whitsuntide
Lancelot du Lake left Arthur's court at
Camelot and rode afar in search of adventures. And
after a long journey, in which many strange things
came to pass, he arrived at Listengeise, the land
of King Pellam. Here he rescued the king's fair
daughter, Elaine, from a dismal enchantment, under
which she had long lain through the wiles of Morgan
le Fay and the queen of Northgalis, who hated
her bitterly from her renown for beauty.</p>

<p>After the rescue of the lady, Lancelot fought
with and killed a mighty serpent that haunted a
tomb near by, and had done much harm in the
land. Then there came to him a dignified and noble
baron, who thanked him heartily in the name of
the king, and invited him to a repast in the castle
hall.</p>

<p>But as they sat at table a wonderful thing took
place. For in at the open window of the hall
there flew a dove, which bore in its mouth what
seemed a little censer of gold. And from this censer
came such a rich and penetrating perfume as if
all the spicery of the world had been there, while
upon the table suddenly appeared the most delicious
of meats and drinks. Then came in a damsel,
young and beautiful, who bore in her hands a
vessel of gold, before which all who were there
kneeled and prayed devoutly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 388px;">
<a name="Quest_Pg_118" id="Quest_Pg_118"></a><img src="images/p118.jpg" width="388" height="500" alt="ON THE QUEST OF THE HOLY GRAIL." title="ON THE QUEST OF THE HOLY GRAIL." />
<span class="caption">ON THE QUEST OF THE HOLY GRAIL.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>"What may all this mean?" asked Lancelot in
deep surprise.</p>

<p>"It has been granted you to see the most precious
and wonderful thing in the world," answered the
noble baron. "For you have been permitted to
gaze upon the holy Sangreal. In the time to come
all Arthur's knights shall take part in a quest for
this precious talisman, and great shall be the woe
therefrom, for through that quest the Round Table
fellowship shall be broken up and many of its
noble knights destroyed."</p>

<p>But all that passed in that land is too much for
us to tell. We shall say only that the fair Elaine
came to love Lancelot dearly, but he gave her no
love in return, for all the affection of his heart
was centred upon Queen Guenever. Yet King Pellam
so desired that Lancelot should wed his fair
daughter that in the end he used enchantment, and
brought him to make her his wife when under a
magic spell, the deluded knight fancying that it
was Guenever whom he had wedded.</p>

<p>This delusion last not long, and when the deceived
spouse came to his senses and learned how
he had been dealt with, he broke away like a madman,
and, gaining his horse, rode wildly through
the land. And every knight-errant who dared to
joust with him was made to suffer from the fury
that burned in his blood.</p>

<p>Long afterwards, as chance and adventure
brought about, there came to King Pellam's castle
Sir Bors de Ganis, Lancelot's nephew. He was
gladly received, and treated with all the good cheer
and honor which the castle could afford. And as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
he sat at his repast with, the castle lords, there
came in, as it had come to Lancelot, the dove with
the censer, at which the air was filled with the
richest perfume, and the table covered with the
most delicious viands. Then entered the maiden
with the holy grail, and all fell to their prayers.</p>

<p>"Truly," said Bors, "this is a strange place, and
a land full of marvels."</p>

<p>"This I will say," answered the noble baron who
sat in the king's chair, "that of the knights who
come here few see the holy vessel, and fewer go
away with any honor. Gawaine, the good knight,
was here but lately; but he saw not what your
eyes have beheld, and he left here in shame. None
but those of a worshipful life and who love God
devoutly can behold this marvel, or sleep in this
castle without coming to harm."</p>

<p>"I am in quest of adventures," said Bors, "and
shall lie in your castle this night, come what will.
Men call me honest and virtuous, and I stand
ready to dare all perils the castle may hold."</p>

<p>"I counsel you not," said the baron. "You will
hardly escape without harm and shame."</p>

<p>"Let come what will come, I am ready."</p>

<p>"Then I advise you to confess, and go to your
chamber with a clean soul, for you will be sorely
tried."</p>

<p>"Let it be so. Your counsel is wise."</p>

<p>After Sir Bors had been confessed and received
absolution, he was led into a fair large chamber,
around which were many doors, while a bed of royal
richness stood in the middle of the floor. Here
he was left alone, and threw himself on the bed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
his armor, deeming it wise to be prepared for all
that might come.</p>

<p>Not long had he lain there with open eyes and
alert wits, when the room was all at once brilliantly
lighted up, though whence the light came he could
not tell. And suddenly a great and long spear,
whose point burnt like a taper, shot across the
chamber without hand to guide it, and struck him
in the shoulder so fierce a blow that his armor
was pierced, and he received a wound, a hand's-breadth
in depth, which pained him bitterly.</p>

<p>Quickly afterwards an armed knight strode in,
with shield on shoulder and sword in hand, who
cried in a harsh voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arise, sir knight, and fight with me."</p>

<p>"I shall not fail you," said Bors, hot with the
pain of his wound. "I am sorely hurt, but I have
vowed boldly to dare aught that might come to me.
If that burning spear came from your hand you
shall pay dearly for it."</p>

<p>With these words he sprang from the bed and
attacked the intruder, and a hard and stern battle
began, which lasted long. At the end the intruding
knight was driven backward to a chamber door,
through which he passed, leaving Bors master of
the floor.</p>

<p>But hardly had he rested a minute when the
defeated knight returned, as fresh as at the start,
and attacked Bors with renewed strength. Again
the battle went on fiercely. But when Bors saw his
antagonist once more retreating towards the chamber
door, he cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not so, my good fellow. You played that trick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
on me once; you shall not again. Back and defend
yourself. If you defeat me it shall be by strength,
not by magic." And he stationed himself before
the door, and drove back his opponent with such
fury, that in a moment more he hurled him to
the floor.</p>

<p>"Yield, or you die!" he cried, setting his foot
on the fallen knight's head.</p>

<p>"I yield," came the answer.</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"I am Sir Pedivere of the Straight Marches."</p>

<p>"Then, Sir Pedivere of the Straight Marches,
take yourself away. And if you have any of your
fellows behind yonder door, bid them to keep out
of this room, for I came here to sleep, not to fight.
At Whitsunday next, present yourself at King
Arthur's court, and tell him that you have come
thither as a prisoner of Sir Bors of the sharp
sword."</p>

<p>This, Sir Pedivere swore to do, and left his conqueror
to what rest he could get. But this was
little, for enchantment surrounded the daring
knight. The room suddenly became full of frightful
noises and alive with peril. Whence they came he
knew not, whether through doors or windows, but
a flight of arrows and of crossbow bolts filled the
air, whistling shrewdly past his ears, while many
of them fell upon him and pierced his flesh through
the open places in his armor.</p>

<p>"Who can sleep in such a den of witchcraft as
this?" he cried, in a rage, springing from the bed.
As he did so one of the doors opened, and a great
lion leaped fiercely in, with a hideous roar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>"It is better to fight a lion that one can see,
than arrows which nobody shoots," cried Bors, and
he rushed without hesitation on the dangerous
animal.</p>

<p>Sharp was the fight that followed, but of short
duration. The lion sprang wildly upon him, and
tore the shield from his arm, while the sharp claws
rent his flesh. But the knight retorted with a
sweeping stroke that cut off the frightful beast's
head, and stretched its tawny body lifeless on the
floor.</p>

<p>Then Bors walked to the window to see whither
the arrows had come, and as he looked into the
castle court he beheld a wondrous sight. For before
his eyes stood a dragon, huge and horrible of
aspect, in whose forehead were letters of gold which
seemed to him to form King Arthur's emblem. And
as he gazed there leaped into the court an old
and mighty leopard, which sprang upon the dragon
and engaged in desperate battle with the huge
monster.</p>

<p>At last the dragon spit out of its mouth a hundred
of what seemed small dragons, and these
quickly leaped upon the frightful beast and rent it
to fragments. Then all the animals disappeared,
and an old man came into the court, around whose
neck two adders wreathed their folds. In his
hand was a harp, upon which he played, while he
sang an old song telling how Joseph of Arimathea
came to that land. When his song was ended he
said to Sir Bors,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go from this land, sir knight, for you shall
have no more adventures here. You have played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
your part well and nobly, and shall do still better
hereafter, for wondrous things are reserved for you."</p>

<p>Then Bors saw a dove of whitest plumage fly
across the court with a golden censer in its mouth,
from which seemed to stream the most delicious
perfumes. And the tempest which had raged in the
sky suddenly ceased, while from the rent clouds
the full moon poured down its white light to the
earth.</p>

<p>Next there came into the court four children
who bore four tapers, and an old man in their midst
with a censer in one hand a spear in the other,
and that spear was called the spear of vengeance.</p>

<p>"Go to your cousin, Sir Lancelot," said the old
man, "and tell him what you have seen, and that
if he had been as clean of sin as he should be, the
adventure which all this signifies would have been
his. Tell him, moreover, that though in worldly
adventures he passes all others in manhood and
prowess, there are many his betters in spiritual
worth, and that what you have seen and done this
night he was not deemed worthy of."</p>

<p>Then Bors saw four meanly-dressed gentlewomen
pass through his chamber, and enter an apartment
beyond which was lit up with a light like that of
midsummer. Here they knelt before an altar of
silver with four pillars, where also kneeled a man
in the dress of a bishop. And as the knight looked
upward he beheld a naked sword hovering over his
head, whose blade shone like silver, yielding a flashing
light that blinded him as he gazed. As he
stood thus sightless, he heard a voice which said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go hence, Sir Bors, for as yet thou art not
worthy to be in this place."</p>

<p>Then the door of that chamber closed, and he
went backward to his bed, where he lay and slept
undisturbed till morning dawned. But when the
regent of King Pellam learned what had happened
to his guest in the night, and how he had escaped
the perils of the enchanted chamber, he greeted him
joyfully, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are the first that ever endured so well
that chamber's mysteries. And more has been
shown to your eyes than any others have seen. Go
home, worthy knight. You are chosen for great
deeds in the time to come."</p>

<p>Sir Bors thereupon took his horse and rode away,
thinking long and deeply on all that had happened
to him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h4>THE MARVEL OF THE FLOATING SWORD.</h4>


<p>Many and strange were the events that followed
those we have just related, and great trouble and
woe came therefrom. For when Sir Bors returned
to Camelot and told the story of the wedding of
Lancelot and Elaine, much was the secret talk and
great the scandal. And when the news came to
Guenever's ears she flamed with wrath.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards, Lancelot returned, still half
frenzied with the deception that had been practised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
upon him. When Guenever saw him she accused
him bitterly of being a traitor to love, and harshly
bade him leave the court, and never come again
within her sight.</p>

<p>This bitter reviling turned Lancelot's frenzy to a
sudden madness. With distracted brain he leaped
from a window into a garden, and ran like a wild
man through wood and brake, heedless that his
clothes were torn and his flesh rent with thorns
and briers. Thus hotly burns despised love in the
human heart and brain, and thus it may turn the
strongest senses away and bring madness to the
clearest mind.</p>

<p>On learning what had passed, Bors and Hector
went to the queen, and accused her harshly of the
great wrong she had done to the noble Lancelot.
But she was already torn with remorse, and she
knelt before these noble knights, begging their forgiveness,
and praying them pitifully to seek Lancelot
and bring him back to the court.</p>

<p>Months passed and Lancelot returned not, nor
could he be found, though he was sought through
many lands. For he kept afar from cities and
courts, and roamed through wilds and wastes, where
he had many adventures in his madness, and did
strange and wild things.</p>

<p>For two years he wandered hither and thither in
frenzy, until at length he came to King Pellam's
city of Corbin, and to the castle where dwelt the
fair Elaine. Here he was given shelter in a little
outhouse, with straw to sleep on, while every day
they threw him meat and set him drink, for none
would venture near a madman of such savage aspect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>But one day as he slept, Elaine chanced to behold
him, and knew him at once for Lancelot. Telling
a trusty baron of her discovery, she had the distracted
knight borne still sleeping into a tower
chamber in which was kept the holy vessel, the
Sangreal, concealed from all eyes save those of persons
of saintly life. Lancelot was laid near this,
and when all had left the chamber a man of sanctity
entered and uncovered the vessel. Such was its
holy influence that it wrought marvellously upon
the distracted knight as he lay there asleep and
the madness passed away from his brain. When he
woke he was himself again, as whole a man in
mind and body as any that stood upon the earth.
For so healing was the virtue of that precious vessel
that it not only drove the cloud of madness from his
mind, but gave him back all his old might and
comeliness of body.</p>

<p>Then, ashamed of his frenzy, and anxious not
to be known, Lancelot assumed the name of the
Chevalier Mal Fet, or the knight who has trespassed,
and took up his abode with Elaine and
many knights and ladies at a castle given him by
King Pellam. This stood on an island in the
midst of a deep and clear lake, which Lancelot
named the Joyous Isle. And now, filled again
with martial fervor, he made it known far and wide
that he would joust with any knights that came that
way, and that any one who should put him to the
worst would receive as a prize a jewel of worth and
a jerfalcon.</p>

<p>But none won the prize, though very many noble
knights jousted with the Chevalier Mal Fet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>Last of all came Percivale and Hector, who had
been long in search of Lancelot. Learning the
challenge, Percivale jousted with Lancelot, and
afterwards they fought with swords. So long and
even was their combat, that a length both paused
for breath. And now Percivale, wondering who
this sturdy knight could be, told his name, and
asked for his in return. At this, Lancelot threw
away his weapon, and took his late opponent in
his arms, crying out that he was Lancelot du Lake.</p>

<p>Glad was the meeting between these old friends
and comrades, and richly were the new-comers entertained
in the castle. But in the end they persuaded
Lancelot to go with them to Camelot, and
the disconsolate Elaine was left to return, with
her knights and ladies, to her father's castle.</p>

<p>After these events years came and went, until
many summers and winters had passed over England's
fair isle, and age had begun to lay its hand
on those who had been young, while those who
had been children grew up and became knights
and ladies. Then came at length the time fixed
by destiny for the adventure of the Sangreal. And
thus this adventure began.</p>

<p>When again approached the vigil of Pentecost,
and all the fellowship of the Round Table had
come to Camelot, and the tables were set to dine,
there rode into the great hall a gentlewoman of
noble aspect, whose horse was white with sweat and
foam.</p>

<p>She saluted Lancelot and begged him to go with
her, though whither and for what purpose she would
not say. Stirred by his love of adventure, he armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
and rode with her, and before the day's end reached
an abbey of nuns in a secluded valley. Here, as
he stood conversing with the abbess, there came in
to him twelve nuns, bringing with them a youth
who had not yet reached manhood, but was large
and powerful of frame, and as handsome of face
as any man he had ever seen.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the ladies, with weeping eyes, "we
bring you this child, whom we have long nourished,
and pray you to make him a knight; for
there is no worthier man from whom he can receive
the order of knighthood, and we hold him
worthy of your sword."</p>

<p>Lancelot looked long at the young squire, and
saw that he was seemly, and demure as a dove,
and of wonderful beauty of form and features,
and his heart went out with great love for the
beautiful youth.</p>

<p>"What is his name?" asked Lancelot.</p>

<p>"We call him Galahad."</p>

<p>"Comes this desire from himself?"</p>

<p>"It does," said they all.</p>

<p>"From whom has he sprung?"</p>

<p>"His mother is dead. His father is a full noble
knight, as you shall soon learn."</p>

<p>"Then he shall be knighted by my hand to-morrow
at the morning services, for truly he seems
worthy of it."</p>

<p>That night, Lancelot's cousins, Bors and Lionel,
stopped at the abbey, and spent there a cheery
evening with their noble kinsman. At early morn
of the next day he gave the accolade to the youth,
pronouncing him knight, and bidding Bors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Lionel to stand as his godfathers in the order of
knighthood.</p>

<p>"And may God make you a good man and a
noble knight," he said. "Beauty you have now,
equal to any I have ever seen, and strength and
courage I doubt not; if you bear with these a
noble heart and an earnest mind you have the best
treasures that God can confer or man possess."</p>

<p>Then, when they had broken their fast, Lancelot
said to the demure and modest young knight,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fair sir, will you come with me to the court
of King Arthur?"</p>

<p>"I humbly beg your pardon," said Galahad, "but
I cannot come at this time. Trust me to follow
soon."</p>

<p>Then Lancelot and his cousins left the abbey
and rode to Camelot, where they arrived before
the hour of the feast. In the great hall were many
noble knights, some of them strangers, who walked
about the Round Table, reading the names in letters
of gold in the several seats, and saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here sits Gawaine, here Lancelot, here Percivale,"
and so with the others.</p>

<p>At length they came to the seat perilous, in which
no man but Percivale had hitherto dared to sit,
and which he no longer occupied. To their deep
surprise they found there newly written in letters
of gold these words,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Four hundred and fifty-four winters after the
passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, the knight shall
come for whom this seat is held by destiny."</p>

<p>"What marvellous thing is this?" cried all who
saw it. "Here is a miracle."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>"In the name of God, what means it?" cried
Lancelot. "Percivale long since had warning to
leave that seat. Who shall fill it to-day, for this
is the feast of Pentecost of the four hundred and
fifty-fourth year. The year and day have come,
but where and who is the man? I advise that
these letters be hidden, till he come for whom
this seat is pre-ordained."</p>

<p>Then it was ordered that the writing should be
covered with a cloth of silk; and the king bade his
guests to hasten to dinner, and forget for the time
being what they had seen.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Kay, the steward, "if you go to
table now you will break your old custom, not to
sit at dinner on this day till you have seen or
heard of some adventure."</p>

<p>"Very true," said the king. "I had forgotten
my custom through this strange event."</p>

<p>As they stood thus speaking, there came hastily
into the court a squire, whose eyes were big with
wonder.</p>

<p>"Sire, I bring you marvellous tidings," he cried
to the king.</p>

<p>"What are they?" demanded Arthur.</p>

<p>"As I stood but now by the river, I saw floating
on its waters a great square stone, and above this
stood the hilt of a sword, whose blade was thrust
deeply into the stone."</p>

<p>"A stone that floats!" said the king. "That is
strange, indeed. I must see this marvel."</p>

<p>Then he, followed by all the knights, went to
the river, and saw there that the squire had spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
truly; for a great stone that seemed of red marble
floated like wood on the water, and thrust deeply
into it was a rich sword, in whose pommel were
many jewels of price. As they looked in wonder
the stone whirled inward on an eddy and came
aground at their feet. And now they saw that the
precious stones were set in letters of gold, which
none there could read. But there was a man at
the court learned in strange tongues, and he being
sent for, read these with ease, and thus interpreted
them,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never shall the hand of man draw me from
this stone until he comes by whose side I am to
hang; and he shall be the best knight in the world."</p>

<p>"Lay your hand on this sword and draw it,"
said the king to Lancelot. "To you it surely belongs;
for you are the best knight in the world."</p>

<p>"Best of hand, mayhap, but not of heart and
life," said Lancelot, soberly. "Certes, sir, that
sword is not for me, nor have I the hardiness to
set hand thereto. I had a vision in my last night's
sleep, and this it told me: that he who seeks to
draw that sword, and fails therein, shall in time
receive from it a wound which shall be very long in
healing. And this more I learned, that this same
day, and with the drawing of that sword, shall
begin the marvellous quest of the holy vessel, the
Sangreal. For fate has destined that this precious
amulet shall be sought throughout the world; and
to him who finds it the greatest of earth's honors
shall come."</p>

<p>The king and all the knights heard these words
with wonder, for Lancelot spoke like one inspired.
Then Arthur turned to Gawaine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>"Fair nephew," he said, "try you this task for
my love."</p>

<p>"Saving your good grace," said Gawaine, "that
I shall not do."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, seek to draw the sword at my command."</p>

<p>"Your command I must obey," said Gawaine,
"yet I dread to meddle with magic."</p>

<p>Then he took the sword by the handle, and pulled
with all his might, but he could not stir it.</p>

<p>"I thank you," said the king, "for the trial,
even if you have failed."</p>

<p>"My lord Gawaine," said Lancelot, "bear well
in mind, this sword shall touch you so sore that
you would give the best castle in this kingdom
not to have set your hand thereto."</p>

<p>"It may be," answered Gawaine. "Yet I could
not disobey the command of the king."</p>

<p>Then the king turned to Percivale, and asked
him for his love to try the task.</p>

<p>"Gladly will I," he said, "if only to bear Gawaine
fellowship."</p>

<p>But pull as strongly as he would, the sword
yielded not to his hand. And there were more
there so hardy as to disregard Lancelot's warning
and seek to draw the sword, but to no hand would
it yield.</p>

<p>"Try no more," said Kay to the king. "You
have seen your marvel, and now may, with a good
appetite, go to your dinner."</p>

<p>This advice seemed timely to the king, and all
went to the court, where the knights took their
seats at the Round Table, and were served by young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
men lately made knights. When they had been
fully served, every seat being filled save the seat
perilous, another marvellous thing happened. For
suddenly all the doors and windows of the hall shut
of themselves. Yet the room was not greatly darkened,
and men looked into one another's faces
with abashed and frightened visages.</p>

<p>"Fair fellows and lords," said the king, "this is
a day of strange events. And I doubt if we shall
not see greater before night comes, for it seems a
day set aside by the fates."</p>

<p>As he spoke, there came into the hall an ancient
man, clothed all in white, but no knight knew
through which door he had entered. By the hand
he led a young knight, clad in red armor, but without
sword or shield, an empty scabbard hanging
by his side.</p>

<p>"Peace be with you, fair lords," said the old
man. Then he turned to King Arthur, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, I bring with me a young knight who is of
kingly lineage, and of the kindred of Joseph of
Arimathea. By his hand many strange marvels
are destined to be accomplished."</p>

<p>The king heard these words with close attention,
and answered graciously,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, you are right welcome here, and the young
knight you bring."</p>

<p>Then the old man removed the youth's armor,
and put upon him a coat of red sendal and a mantle
that was furred with ermine. And Lancelot saw
that the young man was he whom he had knighted
that morning at the abbey.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 321px;">
<a name="Joseph_Pg_134" id="Joseph_Pg_134"></a><img src="images/p134.jpg" width="321" height="500" alt="JOSEPH OF ARIMATHEA." title="JOSEPH OF ARIMATHEA." />
<span class="caption">JOSEPH OF ARIMATHEA.</span>
</div>

<p>But the chief wonder of the day was now to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
appear. For the old man said to his young companion,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, follow me." He led him around the table
till they came to the seat perilous, beside which
sat Lancelot. Here the old man lifted up the
silken cloth, and lo! the letters which had been
covered were gone, and new letters of gold were
visible, which read,&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is the seat of Galahad, the high prince."</p>

<p>"Sir," said the old man, "this seat is yours.
Long has it waited your coming."</p>

<p>And he seated him therein, while all the circle
of knights looked on in wonder. Now for the first
time the young knight spoke.</p>

<p>"Dear sir," he said, "you may now depart, for
you have done well what you were commanded to
do. Recommend me to my grandsire, King Pellam,
and say to him that I will come and see him
as soon as I may."</p>

<p>With this the old man departed. Outside there
waited twenty noble squires, who mounted when
he came, and rode away with him. The Knights
of the Round Table marvelled greatly at all this,
and the more so on seeing that he who occupied
that chair of peril was one so tender of age, and
a youth whom no one knew, nor whence he came;
but to one another they privately said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is he by whom the Sangreal shall be
achieved; for none ever sat there before but Percivale,
and he was not long deemed worthy to
occupy that seat."</p>

<p>The talk of this strange event quickly passed
through the palace, and came to the queen, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
heard it with wonder. Those who brought word
said that the youth resembled Sir Lancelot.</p>

<p>"I must see this strange thing," she said, and,
followed by her ladies, she entered the hall.</p>

<p>"It is Sir Lancelot in youth again," she cried,
on looking the young knight in the face. "Fair
sir, tell me truly, what father had you, and what
mother."</p>

<p>"King Pellam is my grandsire," answered Galahad,
"and Elaine was my mother. As for my
father, I know him not."</p>

<p>"Then do I," cried the queen, "for he sits beside
you. Sir Lancelot is your father. You are
son unto the noblest knight that ever wore sword."</p>

<p>At these words Lancelot rose up in haste, for
he had not dreamed of what was to come; and
he clasped the youth in his arms and kissed his fair
young face with a love that overflowed his heart.</p>

<p>"My son!" he said. "Can it be? Greatly, indeed,
have I felt drawn unto you."</p>

<p>"And my heart went out to you, dear father,"
said Galahad, "from the moment I looked upon
your noble face."</p>

<p>The sight of this affecting meeting filled all
hearts there with joy, and the king warmly congratulated
Lancelot on having found so worthy a
son; "for to him, I dare avow," he said, "is destined
that great achievement of the Sangreal of
which you have this day told us."</p>

<p>Then Arthur took Galahad by the hand, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come with me, young sir," and led him from
the palace to the river to show him the marvel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
of the stone. After them followed the knights, and
the queen and ladies of the court, all full of hope
of greater wonders yet to come.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the king, "that sword floated hither
this day. Many knights of great prowess have
tried to draw it and failed."</p>

<p>"That is no marvel," said Galahad. "The sword
is not theirs, but mine. And since I knew it
awaited me I have brought no sword; but its scabbard,
as you may see, hangs by my side."</p>

<p>Then he laid his hand upon the sword, and,
while all eyes opened wide with wonder, drew it
from the stone as easily as if it came from the
water only, and thrust it into the scabbard, saying
to the king,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It fits there better than in a floating stone."</p>

<p>"God has sent it you," said the king. "And I
doubt not he will send you a shield in as marvellous
a manner."</p>

<p>"This is the sword that at one time belonged
to Balin le Savage," said Galahad, "and with
which he killed his brother Balan, in that terrible
joust which happened many years ago. The scabbard
I wear was Balin's scabbard, and it was Merlin
who put the sword into that stone, saying that no
hand should draw it but that of Lancelot, or his
son Galahad. Nor can any man have forgotten
the dolorous stroke which Balin dealt my grandfather
King Pellam, of which he is not yet healed,
nor shall be till I heal him. So has Merlin
prophesied."</p>

<p>As they talked thus a lady on a white palfrey
was seen riding down the river side to where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
stood. Reaching the group, she saluted the king
and queen, and asked if Sir Lancelot were there.</p>

<p>"I am here, fair lady," he answered.</p>

<p>"Sad is it," she said, while tears flowed from
her eyes, "that all your great renown is changed
since this day's dawn."</p>

<p>"Damsel, why say you this?"</p>

<p>"Until to-day you were the best knight in the
world," she answered. "But he who should say
this now would speak falsely, for there has come a
better than you. And this is proved by the adventure
of the sword to which you dared not set your
hand. Remember well what I have said."</p>

<p>"As touches that," rejoined Lancelot, "I never
had the pride of being the best knight in the world,
nor do I envy my son if any worship has passed
from me to him."</p>

<p>"Yet you were the greatest; and still are among
sinful men," she persisted. "And, sir king," she
said to Arthur, "this more I am bid to say, from
the holy lips of Nancien the hermit, that to you
shall fall to-day the greatest of honors; for this
day the Sangreal shall appear in your palace, and
feed you and all your fellowship of the Round
Table!"</p>

<p>With these words she turned her palfrey and
rode away as she had come, leaving all who had
heard her lost in wonder and admiration.</p>

<p>When they had a little got over their wonder
at what they had seen, the king gave orders that the
stone should be taken from the water, saying that
he would have it set up as a monument of those
strange events.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>"And as it may be long before you all come together
here again, I should like to have you joust
in the meadow of Camelot, by way of honor to this
day."</p>

<p>Thus he spoke; but his real purpose was to see
Galahad proved, for he feared that if he once left
the court it might be long before he should see
him again. Then the knights put on their armor
and rode to the meadow in a gallant cavalcade.
Galahad also, at the earnest request of the king,
put on armor, but he would take no shield, though
the king and Lancelot prayed him to do so. The
most he would consent to do was to take a spear.</p>

<p>But noble work he did that day, meeting all
men who cared to break spears with him, so that
by the end of the joust he had thrown down many
good Knights of the Round Table. Only two of
them, Lancelot and Percivale, were able to keep
their seats against the vigorous onset of the strong
young knight.</p>

<p>When the jousting was at an end, the king and
knights went back to Camelot, where they attended
even-song at the great minster. Thence they proceeded
to the palace hall, where all took their seats
at the table for supper.</p>

<p>But as they sat eating, there came outside a
terrible crash of thunder, and a wind arose that
seemed as if it would rend the great hall from its
foundations. In the midst of this blast the hall
was lighted by a sudden gleam seven times brighter
than the midday light, in whose glare the knights
sat dumb, none daring to speak. But each looked
at the others, and it seemed to each that his fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
were fairer of visage than he had ever seen them
before.</p>

<p>Then the storm and the glare passed away as
suddenly as they had come, and there entered the
hall the holy grail. None there saw it, for it was
covered with white samite, but the hall was filled
with the rarest odors, and each knight saw on the
table before him the meats and drinks that he
loved best in the world.</p>

<p>When the holy vessel had passed through the
hall, it suddenly vanished, none knew how. And
not till then dared any man speak.</p>

<p>"Certes," said the king, "we ought to thank
God devoutly for what he has shown us this day."</p>

<p>"We have enjoyed the richest of perfumes, and
have before us the rarest of food," said Gawaine;
"and we have but one thing to regret, that the
sacred vessel was so preciously covered that no eye
might behold it. But this miracle has filled my
soul with the warmest desire to see this holy thing,
and I therefore vow that to-morrow, without delay,
I shall set out in quest of the Sangreal, and shall
not return hither till I have seen it more openly,
if it take me a twelvemonth or more. If I fail
in the end, I shall return as one who is not worthy
to behold the holy vessel."</p>

<p>On hearing these words the other knights arose
as one man, and repeated the vow which Gawaine
had made.</p>

<p>Upon this, King Arthur sprang to his feet in deep
displeasure, for there came to his mind like a
vision a host of evil consequences from this inconsiderate
vow.</p>

<p>"You are over-hasty, Gawaine," he said, sharply,
"and have done me a lifelong evil with your vow.
For you have bereft me of the fairest fellowship
that ever came together in this world. When my
knights depart hence on that difficult search, well
I know that they will never all meet again in this
world, for many shall die in the quest. Therefore
it distresses me deeply, for I have loved them as I
loved my life, and I would rather have my soul
depart from my body than to lose their noble fellowship.
Long have we dwelt together in sorrow
and in joy, but I fear our happy days are at an end,
and that trouble and suffering await us in the time
to come. What God wills must be, but my heart
is sore at the thought of it."</p>

<p>And men who looked upon the king could see
tears of distress and grief flowing from his eyes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h4>HOW GALAHAD GOT HIS SHIELD.</h4>


<p>When morning came the knights made ready for
their departure, amid the tears and lamentations
of ladies, and with the deep sorrow of the king and
queen. For there were a hundred and fifty of them
in all, comprising the whole fellowship of the Table
Round, and King Arthur had deep reason for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
fear that he would never gather all these gallant
knights round his festal board again. And so they
mounted and rode through the streets of Camelot,
where was weeping of rich and poor, and the king
turned away and could not speak for grief, while
Queen Guenever hid herself in her chamber, to be
alone with her bitter sorrow at the going of
Lancelot.</p>

<p>Onward they rode in company until they came
to a castle and town that were named Vagon.
There they stopped and were well entertained by
the lord of the castle, who was a man of great hospitality.
But when morning came it was decided
between them that they should separate, each taking
his own course, so that the Sangreal might be
sought in all quarters. This they did with much
sorrow and many fervent farewells, each knight
taking the way that he liked the best, and riding
alone and afar on his perilous quest.</p>

<p>First must we follow the young knight Galahad,
who still rode without a shield, and who passed
onward for four days without an adventure. Near
eventide of the fourth day he came to a white abbey,
where he was received with great respect, and led
to a chamber that he might lay off his armor. And
here, to his surprise, he met with two of the goodly
company from which he had lately parted, Sir
Uwaine and King Bagdemagus.</p>

<p>"Sirs," said Galahad, "what adventure brought
you hither?"</p>

<p>"We are told," they replied, "that within this
place is a shield of perilous significance. For he
who bears it about his neck runs deep risk of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
slain within three days, or maimed forever. Yet,"
said Bagdemagus, "I shall bear it to-morrow and
try my fortune."</p>

<p>"In the name of God, try it," said Galahad.
"Yet truly you take a great risk."</p>

<p>"If I fail therein, you shall take the adventure.
I am sure you will not fail."</p>

<p>"I agree to that," said Galahad. "I have ridden
far enough without a shield."</p>

<p>Then they went to supper, and afterwards to
sleep. When morning came Bagdemagus asked of
the abbot where the magic shield was, and a monk
led him behind an altar where hung a shield as
white as snow, but with a red cross in its centre.</p>

<p>"I hope you are well advised of what you do,"
said the monk. "No knight, unless he be the
worthiest in the world, can safely bear this shield."</p>

<p>"I know well that I am not the best of knights,"
said Bagdemagus; "and yet I shall wear it and
dare the danger."</p>

<p>Then he took it out of the monastery, and said
to Galahad,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If it please you, await me here till you learn
how I shall speed."</p>

<p>"I shall await tidings," said Galahad.</p>

<p>Bagdemagus now rode forward with a squire,
that he might send back tidings of his good or ill
fortune, and passed onward for two miles, when he
found himself in a valley before a hermitage.
Here he saw a stalwart knight in white armor,
horse and all, who, in seeing the red-cross shield,
rode upon him at the full speed of his charger.
Bagdemagus put his spear in rest and rode to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
him, but his spear broke on the white knight, while
he was wounded in the right shoulder and borne
from his horse, the treacherous shield refusing to
cover him. Then the victor knight alighted and
took the white shield from him, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir knight, you have acted with more folly than
wisdom, for you should have known that only he
who has no peer living can safely bear this shield."</p>

<p>Then he went to the squire who had come with
King Bagdemagus, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bear this shield to the good knight Sir Galahad,
whom you left in the abbey, and greet him
from me."</p>

<p>"What shall I tell him is your name?"</p>

<p>"Take no heed of my name. That is not for
you to know, nor for any earthly man. Content
yourself with telling Sir Galahad that this shield
is for him, and for no other man to wear. And
may God aid him to bear it worthily and worshipfully."</p>

<p>But the squire went first to Bagdemagus and
asked him if he were seriously wounded.</p>

<p>"Forsooth, I am," he said. "I shall scarce
escape from death."</p>

<p>The squire then conveyed him in great pain to
the hermitage, and left him in care of the hermit.
And as the chronicle tells, he lay there long, and
barely escaped with life.</p>

<span class="caption">OATH OF KNIGHTHOOD.</span>
</div>

<p>"Sir Galahad," said the squire, when he had
returned to the abbey, "King Bagdemagus has paid
dearly for his venture. He lies at a hermitage
sorely wounded. As for you, the knight that overthrew
him sends you greeting, and bids you to bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
this shield, through which marvellous adventures
shall come to you."</p>

<p>"Then blessed be God and fortune," said Galahad.</p>

<p>He now resumed his arms and mounted his horse,
hanging the white shield about his neck and commending
himself to God. Uwaine offered to bear
him company, but this was not to be.</p>

<p>"Sir knight," said Galahad, "I thank you for
your offer, but I must go alone, save that this squire
shall bear me fellowship."</p>

<p>With these words the youthful knight rode away,
and soon came to where the white knight abode
by the hermitage. They saluted each other courteously,
and fell into a conversation in which the
white knight told Galahad the story of the magical
shield.</p>

<p>"In the far past time," he said, "soon after
Joseph of Arimathea took down the body of our
Lord from the holy cross, and bore it from Jerusalem
to a city named Sarras, there was a king of
Sarras named Evelake, who was then at war with
the Saracens. This king, through the teachings of
Joseph, was converted from the old law to the new,
and for him this shield was made, in the name of
Him who died on the cross. Afterwards, when
Evelake was in battle, the shield was covered with
a cloth, which was only removed in times of deadly
peril, and then his enemies saw the figure of a man
on the cross, before which they fell back discomfited.
At times the cross of the shield would vanish away,
and at times stand out clear and bright; and such
was its virtue that a soldier whose hand was stricken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
off was made whole again by touching the cross.
The time came at length when Joseph left Palestine
and journeyed westward, and King Evelake with
him, till they came to Great Britain, where all the
people had been pagans, but were then converted
to the Christian faith. Soon afterwards Joseph
sickened and came near to death, and while he lay
in his bed he bade Evelake bring him the shield,
and on it he traced a red cross with his own blood.
Then he said to Evelake, 'No man hereafter shall
bear this shield but he shall repent it, until Galahad,
the last of my lineage, shall come to seek it,
and with it he shall do marvellous deeds.' 'Where
shall the shield await his coming?' asked Evelake.
'You shall leave it in the abbey where Nancien the
hermit shall lie after his death, and thither the
knight Galahad shall come for it soon after he
receives the order of knighthood.' This is the
story of the shield, and this day has the prediction
been fulfilled. Wear the shield worthily and well,
young knight, for much glory and renown shall
come to you through it. You are in God's hands;
to God commend yourself."</p>

<p>With these words the white knight vanished away,
and in the place where he had stood was seen but
empty air.</p>

<p>Then the squire, who had heard these words,
alighted and kneeled at Galahad's feet, praying
that he would make him a knight.</p>

<p>"That I shall consider," said Galahad. "But
now let us return to the abbey."</p>

<p>Here Galahad drove away a fiend that had long
dwelt in a tomb near by, where it made such noise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
that none could venture near it. But the virtue
of the shield protected him from all harm from this
evil shape, which was forced to depart.</p>

<p>When morning came, he asked the young squire
his name.</p>

<p>"Sir," he answered, "men call me Melias de
Lile, and I am the son of the king of Denmark."</p>

<p>"Then, fair sir, since you come of kings and
queens, I shall make you a knight; and look you
that knighthood sit well on you, for you should
be a mirror of chivalry."</p>

<p>"That shall I seek to be," said Melias.</p>

<p>Then Galahad gave him the accolade as he
kneeled before him, and bade him rise a knight.</p>

<p>"Now, dear sir," said Melias, "since you have
done me this high honor, it is but right that you
grant me my first request, so that it be in reason."</p>

<p>"You speak justly," said Galahad.</p>

<p>"I beg, then, that you let me ride with you in
the quest of the Sangreal till some adventure shall
part us."</p>

<p>"That I grant willingly."</p>

<p>Armor was now brought to Melias, and when it
had been girded upon him he and Galahad rode
away, and passed onward all that week without an
adventure. But on the Monday next, as they set
out from an abbey, they came to where a cross
marked a parting of the road. On the cross was
written,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ye knights-errant, that ride in quest of adventures,
here lie two ways. He that takes the right-hand
road shall not leave it again, if he be a good
man and a worthy knight. He that takes the left-hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
shall not lightly win fortune, for his strength
and endurance will be soon tried."</p>

<p>"If you will suffer me to take the left-hand road
I should like it greatly," said Melias. "My
strength and skill need trial."</p>

<p>"It were better not. I fancy that I only should
face the danger that there confronts us."</p>

<p>"Nay, my lord, I pray you let me have this
adventure."</p>

<p>"Take it, then, in God's name," said Galahad;
"and do your duty worthily."</p>

<p>So Melias rode forward and soon found himself
in a forest, through which he passed for two days,
seeing there neither man, woman, nor child. Then
he came from the forest into a broad meadow, where
stood a lodge built of green boughs. And in that
lodge was a chair, on which lay a crown of gold
wrought with rich and subtle skill. Also there
were cloths spread upon the earth, upon which
delicious meats were laid.</p>

<p>Melias beheld all this and thought it marvellous.
He felt no hunger, but the crown of gold roused
his covetousness, and he took it up and rode away
with it. But not far had he ridden when a knight
came after him, who said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir knight, why have you taken that crown?
It is not yours; therefore defend yourself."</p>

<p>Then Melias blessed himself, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fair Lord of Heaven, help and save thy new
made knight."</p>

<p>Then they rode together at full speed, but
Melias's prayer availed him naught, for the spear-head
of the other went through his hauberk, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
wounded him so deeply in the left side that he
fell to the earth like a dead man. Then the victor
knight took the crown and rode away.</p>

<p>But with wise forethought Galahad had followed
Melias, and now rode into the valley, where
he found him in peril of death.</p>

<p>"Ah, Melias!" he cried, "better for you had you
taken the other way. Who has done you this
harm?"</p>

<p>"For God's love, let me not die in this place!"
said Melias in reply. "Bear me to some abbey
near by, where I may be confessed and have the
rites of the church."</p>

<p>"It shall be done," said Galahad. "But where
is he who has wounded you?"</p>

<p>The reply came from the edge of the forest,
where Galahad heard a voice cry in stirring tones,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Knight, defend yourself from me."</p>

<p>"Beware, sir," warned Melias. "He it is that
has left me thus."</p>

<p>"Sir knight," said Galahad, "come on at your
peril."</p>

<p>Then they rode together as fast as their horses
could run, and Galahad drove his spear through
the shoulder of his opponent, hurling him from
his horse. But in his fall the spear broke. Then,
before the young knight could turn, another knight
rode from under the leaves and broke his spear
upon him.</p>

<p>At this treacherous act Galahad drew his sword
in wrath, and with a keen blow smote off the left
arm of his antagonist, whom he pursued into the
forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>He soon returned, however, and took up Melias
gently, for the truncheon of the spear was in his
body, and bore him on his horse in his arms to an
abbey near at hand. Here the wounded knight
was unarmed and laid upon a bed, where the rites
of the church were administered to him.</p>

<p>"Sir Galahad," he then said, "let death come
when it will, I am at peace with God." And he
drew the truncheon of the spear from his body,
and swooned away.</p>

<p>But an old monk who stood there, and who was
a skilful leech, examined the wound, and said, "He
need not die. By the grace of God I hope to heal
him of this wound within seven weeks."</p>

<p>This gladdened Galahad, and he remained at the
abbey three days to see how Melias should fare.
Then he asked him how it stood with him.</p>

<p>"I feel now as if I may live," he answered.</p>

<p>"God be thanked for that," said Galahad.
"Now must I depart, for I have much to do, and
the quest of the Sangreal will not permit long
leisure and delay."</p>

<p>"Sir," said the monk, "it is for his sin this
knight is so bitterly wounded. He took on him
the high order of knighthood without clean confession,
which was a sinful thing to do. As for
the two ways to which you came, the way on the
right betokens the highway of righteousness, and
the way on the left, which he chose, betokens that
of sinners and infidels. And when the devil saw
his presumption in taking the quest of the Sangreal
without being worthy of it, he caused his overthrow.
And when he took the crown of gold he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
sinned in covetousness and theft. As for you, Sir
Galahad, the two knights with whom you fought
signify the two deadly sins which abide in Sir
Melias. But they could not withstand you, for
you are without deadly sin."</p>

<p>"God send I may keep so," said Galahad. "Now
must I depart. I pray you do your utmost for
this knight."</p>

<p>"My Lord Galahad," said Melias, "I shall get
well, and shall seek you as soon as I can ride."</p>

<p>"God grant you speedy health," said Galahad,
and he left the room and sought his horse, and
rode away alone.</p>

<p>After he had ridden for days in various directions,
it chanced that he departed from a place
called Abblasoure, where he had heard no mass, as
was his daily custom. But ere the day was old, he
came to a mountain, on which he found a ruined
chapel, and here he kneeled before the altar, and
besought God's counsel. And as he prayed he heard
a voice that said, "Go now, thou adventurous
knight, to the Castle of Maidens, and do away with
the wicked customs which there are kept."</p>

<p>When Galahad heard this he took his horse and
rode away, full of gladness that he might thus serve
God. And not long nor far had he ridden before
he saw in a valley before him a strong castle, with
high towers and battlements and deep ditches;
and beside it ran a broad river, named the Severn.</p>

<p>Here he met an aged man, whom he saluted,
and asked the castle's name.</p>

<p>"It is the Castle of Maidens," said the old man.</p>

<p>"Then it is a cursed castle, and an abode of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
sin," said Galahad. "All pity is wanting within
those walls, and evil and hardness of heart there
have their abode."</p>

<p>"Then, sir knight, you would do well to turn
and leave it."</p>

<p>"That shall I not," said Galahad. "I have come
here to punish the evil-doers that there abide."</p>

<p>Leaving the old man, he rode forward, and soon
met with seven fair maidens, who said to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir knight, you ride in folly, for you have the
water to pass."</p>

<p>"And why should I not pass the water?" asked
Galahad.</p>

<p>He continued his ride, and next met a squire,
who said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir knight, I bring you defiance from the
knights in the castle, who forbid you to go farther
till they learn your purpose."</p>

<p>"You may tell it to them, if you will. I come
to destroy the wicked customs of this castle."</p>

<p>"Sir, if you abide by that, you will have enough
to do."</p>

<p>"Go now and bear them my answer."</p>

<p>Then the squire returned to the castle, from
which there soon after rode seven knights, in full
armor. When they saw Galahad they cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Knight, be on your guard, for you have come
to your death."</p>

<p>"What!" asked Galahad, "will you all assail me
at once?"</p>

<p>"That shall we; so defend yourself."</p>

<p>Then Galahad rode against them and smote the
foremost such a blow that he nearly broke his neck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
The others rode on him together, each striking his
shield with might. But their spears broke and
he still held his seat.</p>

<p>He now drew his sword, and set upon them with
such energy that, many as they were, he put them
all to flight, chasing them until they entered the
castle, and following them within its walls till they
fled from the castle by another gate.</p>

<p>Galahad was now met by an old man, clad in
religious costume, who said to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, here are the keys of the castle."</p>

<p>Then the victor ordered that all the gates should
be thrown open, and in the streets of the neighboring
town were crowds of people, crying gladly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir knight, you are heartily welcome. Long
have we waited for the deliverance which you
bring us."</p>

<p>And a gentlewoman came, who said to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"These knights are fled, but they will come
again. Therefore, sir, I counsel you to send for
all the knights that hold their lands of this castle,
and make them swear to restore the old customs,
and do away with the evil practices which these
villanous knights have fostered."</p>

<p>"That is good counsel," said Galahad.</p>

<p>Then she brought him a horn of ivory, richly
adorned with gold, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Blow this horn loudly. It will be heard two
miles and more from the castle, and all that hear
it will come."</p>

<span class="caption">SIR GALAHAD FIGHTING THE SEVEN SINS.</span>
</div>

<p>Galahad took the horn, and blew so loud a blast
that the very trees shook therewith. Then he
seated himself and waited to see what would come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
from the summons. As he sat there a priest came
to him and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir knight, for seven years these brethren have
held the castle, whose lord, Duke Lianor, they
killed, and held his daughter prisoner; and by
force they have kept all the knights of the castle
under their power, and have acted as tyrants, robbing
the common people of all they had, and taking
tribute and demanding service from all the country
round. Seven years ago the duke's daughter said
to them, 'You shall not hold this castle for many
years, for by one knight you shall be overcome.'
'Say you so,' they replied. 'Then shall never
knight or lady pass this castle, but all that come
shall stay or lose their heads, till comes that knight
of whom you prophesy.' Therefore this is called
the Maidens' Castle, since its tyrants have so long
made war upon maidens."</p>

<p>"Is the duke's daughter still here?"</p>

<p>"No; she died three days after the castle was
taken. But her younger sister and many other
ladies are held prisoners."</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the knights of the country began
to flock in, in response to the bugle-call, and glad
were they to find what had occurred. Galahad
made them do homage and fealty to the duke's
daughter, which they did with great willingness
of heart.</p>

<p>And when the next day dawned great news was
brought in, for a messenger came to Galahad and
told him that the seven felon brothers had been met
by Gawaine, Gareth, and Uwaine, and all slain.</p>

<p>"So ends their rule and power," said Galahad,
fervently. "It is well done, and well are all here
delivered."</p>

<p>Then he commended them to God, and took his
armor and horse, and rode away amid the prayers
of those he had delivered.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h4>THE TEMPTATION OF SIR PERCIVALE.</h4>


<p>Many adventures had the other knights that set
out in search of the Sangreal, and much reproof
did many of them receive for the evil lives they
had led; but all this we cannot stop to tell, but must
confine ourselves to the deeds of a few only. As
for Sir Gawaine, he parted from Gareth and
Uwaine after they had slain the seven wicked
knights of the Castle of Maidens, and rode from
Whitsuntide to Michaelmas without an adventure.
Then came a day in which he met Sir Hector de
Maris, and glad were both at the meeting.</p>

<p>"Truly," said Gawaine, "I am growing weary
of this quest."</p>

<p>"And I as well," said Hector. "And of the
twenty knights I have met from time to time, they
all complain as we do."</p>

<p>"Have you met with Lancelot?"</p>

<p>"No, nor with Percivale, Bors, or Galahad. I
can learn nothing of these four."</p>

<p>"They are well able to take care of themselves,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
said Gawaine. "And if they fail to find the Sangreal,
it is waste of time for the rest of us to seek
it, for outside of them there is little virtue in the
Round Table fellowship."</p>

<p>Afterwards these two knights went far in company,
and had strange dreams and visions, the
meaning of which was expounded to them by the
hermit Nancien. This holy man also reproved
Gawaine severely for his evil life, and bade both
him and his companion to give up the search for
the Sangreal, as that high achievement was not
for hands like theirs.</p>

<p>Soon after they met an armed knight in the
road, who proffered to joust with them. Gawaine
accepted the challenge, and rode against this unknown
opponent, dealing him so severe a blow that
he was hurled from his horse with a mortal wound.
But when they had removed his helmet, what was
their horror to find that it was their friend and
comrade, Uwaine.</p>

<p>"Alas!" cried Gawaine, "that such a fatal misadventure
should have befallen me! I would
sooner have died myself."</p>

<p>"Thus ends my quest of the Sangreal," said
Uwaine. "And thus will end that of many a
noble knight. Dear friends, commend me to King
Arthur, and to my fellows of the Round Table, and
sometimes think of me for old brotherhood's sake."</p>

<p>And he died in their arms, leaving them plunged
in the deepest grief, from which they were long in
recovering.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lancelot and Percivale rode far in
company, and many things happened to them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
While journeying through a strange region they
met an unknown knight, whom they challenged
to joust. But the event turned out little to their
satisfaction, for Lancelot was hurled to the ground,
horse and man, and Percivale received so fierce a
sword-blow that he would have been slain had not
the sword swerved.</p>

<p>Then the victor knight rode rapidly away, leaving
them to recover as they best could. But a
recluse near whose hut this encounter had taken
place told them that the victor was Sir Galahad.
On learning this they pursued him at all speed,
but in vain.</p>

<p>Percivale now turned back to question the recluse
further, but Lancelot kept on, passing through
waste and forest till he came to a stone cross at the
parting of two ways.</p>

<p>Near by was a ruined chapel, with broken door,
and other signs of waste and decay, if it had been
long deserted. But when he looked within he saw
to his great surprise a high altar richly dressed
with cloth of white silk, on which stood a lofty
candelabra of silver which bore six great candles,
all lighted.</p>

<p>Lancelot sought to enter the chapel, but try as
he would he could not pass the broken door, nor
find entrance elsewhere. Some invisible power
seemed to stand between him and admission to that
sacred place.</p>

<p>Then, out of heart at this ill success, he took
off his helm and sword, relieved his horse of saddle
and bridle, and lay down to sleep before the cross.
Night came upon him as he lay there, and with
the night came strange visions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>For as he lay but half asleep he saw a sick knight
brought thither in a litter. This knight prayed
earnestly for aid in his affliction, and as he did so
Lancelot saw the silver candlestick come from the
chapel to the cross, and after it a table of silver
on which was the holy grail. The sick knight
crawled painfully to it on his hands and knees,
and raised himself so as to touch and kiss the
sacred vessel. No sooner had he done so than he
grew whole and sound, with all his pain and sickness
gone, and rose to his feet with his former
strength and vigor.</p>

<p>"Lord, I thank thee deeply," he said; "for
through thy infinite grace I am healed of my affliction."</p>

<p>Then the holy vessel returned to the chapel, and
Lancelot strove hard to rise and follow it. But
his limbs were powerless, and he lay like one chained
to the ground.</p>

<p>He now fell into deep slumber, and waked not
till near morning. And as he raised himself and
sat on the ground he heard a voice in the air, that
seemed to come from no earthly lips.</p>

<p>"Sir Lancelot," it said, "more hard than is the
stone, more bitter than the wood, more bare than
the barren fig-tree, arise and go from hence, and
withdraw thyself from this holy place."</p>

<p>Lancelot arose with a heavy heart, for the sense
of these words sank deeply within him. But when
he sought his horse and helm and sword he found
they were gone, for they had been taken by the
knight whose healing he had seen.</p>

<p>Deeply depressed and unhappy at this misfortune,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
he left the cross on foot, and wandered onward
till he came to a hermitage on a high hill.</p>

<p>Here he told the hermit what had happened to
him, and confessed all the evil deeds of his life,
saying that he had resolved to be a different man
from what he had been, and to live a higher life
than that of doing deeds of arms that men might
applaud.</p>

<p>Then the holy man gave him absolution, with
injunctions of penance, and prayed that he would
abide with him all that day. This Lancelot did,
talking much with him upon his sins, and repenting
sincerely the worldly life he had led.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Percivale had returned to the recluse,
and questioned her as to how he should find Galahad.</p>

<p>"That I cannot surely tell," she said. "Ride
hence to a castle which is called Goothe, where he
has a cousin-german. If he can give you no tidings,
then ride straight to the castle Carbonek,
where the maimed king lies, and there you shall
hear sure tidings of him."</p>

<p>Percivale, leaving her, rode onward till eventide,
and as he looked around him for shelter he heard
a clock strike loud and clear. He now perceived
before him a mansion, with lofty walls and deep
ditches. Here he knocked loudly, and was let in
without delay.</p>

<p>After laying off his armor, he was led to the supper
hall, where he was well served, and afterwards
spent the night in comfort. When morning dawned
he entered the chapel for the mass, and found
there a priest ready at the altar. On the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
side was a pew closed with iron, and behind the
altar a rich bed, covered with cloth of silk and
gold. On this bed lay a person with covered visage,
so that he could not tell if it were man or woman.</p>

<p>After the service was over the occupant of the
bed sat up and threw back the covering, and then
Percivale saw that it was a man of very great age,
on whose head was a crown of gold. But his
shoulders and body to the middle were unclad, and
were covered with wounds, as were also his arms
and face.</p>

<p>To all seeming he might have been three hundred
years of age, for so venerable a face Percivale had
never gazed upon, and as he sat up he prayed fervently,
with joined hands. When the mass was
over the priest bore the sacrament to the sick king.
And when he had used it, he took off his crown
and commanded it to be set on the altar. Then he
lay down again.</p>

<p>Percivale now asked one of the attendants who
this venerable man was.</p>

<p>"You have heard of Joseph of Arimathea," was
the reply, "and how he came into this land to
convert the heathen. With him came a king named
Evelake, whom he had converted in the city of
Sarras, in Palestine. This king afterwards had
an earnest desire to be where the Sangreal was, and
on one occasion he ventured so nigh it that God
was displeased with him, and struck him almost
blind. Then King Evelake prayed for mercy and
pardon, and begged that he might not die until
he who was to achieve the Sangreal should come,
that he might see him and kiss him. There answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
him a voice that said: 'Thy prayers are
heard; thou shalt not die till he has kissed thee.
And when he comes thy eyes shall be opened to see
clearly, and thy wounds shall be healed; but not
until then.' So King Evelake has lived in this
mansion for three hundred winters, waiting for
the coming of the knight who shall heal him.
Now, sir, will you tell me what knight you are,
and if you are of the Round Table fellowship?"</p>

<p>"That am I, and my name is Percivale de
Galis."</p>

<p>On hearing this the good man welcomed Percivale
warmly, and pressed him to remain. But
the knight replied that he could not, for his duty
led him onward.</p>

<p>Percivale now left the chapel, and, arming himself,
he took his horse and rode onward. And
that day more strange things happened to him than
we have space to tell. Not far had he ridden when
he met twenty men-at-arms, who bore on a bier a
dead knight. On learning that he was from King
Arthur's court, they assailed him fiercely, killed
his horse, and would have slain him; but when he
was at the worst strait a knight in red armor came
hastily to his rescue, and rode fiercely on the
assailants.</p>

<p>He attacked these, indeed, with such fury that
many of them were soon stretched on the ground;
while the others fled into a thick forest, whither
they were hotly pursued by their assailant.</p>

<p>On seeing him thus ride away, Percivale was
deeply grieved, for he well knew his rescuer was
Galahad, and he had no horse to follow him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>He went forward as fast as he could on foot, and
had not gone far when he met a yeoman riding on
a hackney, and leading a great war-horse, blacker
than any bear.</p>

<p>Percivale begged that he would lend him this
horse, that he might overtake a knight before him.
But this the yeoman refused, saying that the owner
of the horse would slay him if he should do so.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards, as Percivale sat woebegone
beneath a tree, an armed knight came riding past
on the black horse, pursued by the yeoman, who
called him robber, and moaned bitterly that his
master would kill him for the loss of his charge.</p>

<p>"Lend me your hackney," said Percivale; "I
may get you your horse again."</p>

<p>This the yeoman gladly did, and Percivale pursued
the robber knight, loudly bidding him to
stand and deliver.</p>

<p>The knight at this turned and rode fiercely upon
him, but directed his spear against the horse instead
of the rider, striking it in the breast, so that it
fell to the earth.</p>

<p>He now rode away, without heeding Percivale's
angry demand that he should stop and fight it out
on foot. When the dismounted knight found that
his antagonist would not turn, he was so filled
with chagrin that he threw away his helm and
sword, and raved like one out of his wits. Thus
he continued till night came on, when he lay down
exhausted and fell into a deep slumber.</p>

<p>Near the midnight hour he suddenly awakened,
and saw in the road before him a woman, who
said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>"Sir Percivale, what do you here?"</p>

<p>"I do neither good nor ill," he replied.</p>

<p>"You need a horse," she said. "If you will
promise to do my will when I shall summon you,
I will lend you mine. You will find him no common
one."</p>

<p>"I promise that," cried Percivale. "I would
do much for a horse just now."</p>

<p>"Wait, then; I shall fetch you the noblest animal
you ever bestrode."</p>

<p>She departed, but quickly came again, leading
a horse of midnight blackness, and richly apparelled
for knightly service.</p>

<p>Percivale looked at it with admiration. He had
not hoped for so great and noble a steed as this.
Thanking her warmly, he sprang to his feet, leaped
to the saddle, and put spurs to the horse, from
whose nostrils fire seemed to glare.</p>

<p>Away went the black horse under the moonlight,
making such marvellous strides that it seemed to
leave the earth behind it in its magical progress.
With such wondrous speed did it go that in an
hour it had made a four days' journey. Then it
came to the brink of a great body of water, whose
waves foamed and leaped boisterously against the
shore.</p>

<p>When Percivale saw the heaving waves, which
stretched far away under the moonlight, he drew
with all his force upon the rein; but the fiendish
brute which he rode heeded not his hand, but bore
him madly to the brink. Fear and doubt now
filled the knight's mind, and with a hasty impulse
he made the sign of the cross. At this the beast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
roared loudly in rage, while flame a foot long
poured from its nostrils, and with a wild rear it
shook off its rider, and plunged madly into the
wild billows. And the showering drops which fell
upon Percivale from the plunge burnt like sparks
of fire.</p>

<p>"God be thanked that I am here alive," cried
the knight, fervently. "I have ridden the foul
fiend in the image of a horse, and barely have I
escaped perdition."</p>

<p>Then he commended himself to God, and prayed
earnestly to the Lord to save him from all such
perils and temptations. He continued in prayer
all the remainder of that night until the next day
dawned upon the earth.</p>

<p>When sunrise came he looked needfully about
him, anxious to learn whither he had been borne
by the unholy brute. To his surprise and alarm
he found himself in a wild waste, which was closed
in on one side by the sea, and on the other by a
range of rough and high mountains, impassable
to human feet; a land that seemed without food
or shelter, and the lurking-place of wild beasts.</p>

<p>He trembled with fear on seeing this, and went
forward with doubtful steps. Not far had he gone
before he saw a strange thing, for a great serpent
passed near him, bearing a young lion by the neck.
Fiercely after it came a great lion, roaring with
rage, and fell upon the serpent, which turned in
defence, so that a mighty battle was waged before
the knight.</p>

<p>"By my faith," he cried, "the lion is the most
natural beast of the two, and it fights for its young.
The lion it is my duty to help."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>He drew his sword with these words and struck
the serpent so fierce a stroke that it fell dead.
Then he turned his shield against the lion, but as
the latter made no show of fighting him, but fawned
upon him with every mark of joy and gratitude,
he cast down his shield and removed his helm,
and sat there stroking the neck and shoulders of
the beast.</p>

<p>Until noon he comforted himself with the fellowship
of the lion. Then it took up its whelp
and bore it away, leaving Percivale alone. But he
was not unhappy, for he believed fervently in God,
and prayed with all earnestness that he might be
saved from unholy things, and chosen as a champion
of right and truth.</p>

<p>When night came, Percivale, to his joy, saw the
lion coming towards him. It crouched at his feet
like a spaniel, and all that night the lion and the
knight slept in company, his head being pillowed
on the shoulder of the beast.</p>

<p>But during the night a strange dream came to
him. He seemed to see two women, one of whom
was young, and rode upon a lion, and the other
was old, and sat upon a gliding serpent. And the
younger spoke to him as follows,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir Percivale," she said, "my lord salutes you,
and sends a warning to you to make ready, for to-morrow
you will have to fight with the strongest
champion in the world. And if overcome you
will be shamed to the world's end."</p>

<p>"Who is your lord?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The greatest lord in all the world," she said;
and then suddenly vanished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>Then came the lady upon the serpent, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir Percivale, I have done you no harm, and
yet you have worked me injury."</p>

<p>"What have I done? I have been always heedful
to offend no lady."</p>

<p>"I have long nourished here a great serpent,
and yesterday you killed it for seeking its prey.
Why did you this? The lion was not in your
care."</p>

<p>"I aided the lion because it was a nobler beast
than the serpent. In that I did nothing against
you."</p>

<p>"You did me a great wrong, and in return for
this injury I demand that you become my man."</p>

<p>"That shall I never be," he answered.</p>

<p>"Beware, then, proud knight, who pride yourself
on your piety. You have robbed me of that
which I loved; take heed that I catch you not
unawares, or mine you shall be, body and soul."</p>

<p>With these words she departed, and Percivale
finished his sleep without further vision. In the
morning, when he awoke, he felt feeble. And as
he rose and blessed himself he saw not far off in
the sea a ship that sailed towards him. As it came
near he perceived it to be covered within and without
with white samite, while on the deck stood an
old man dressed in a surplice like a priest.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Percivale, "you are welcome."</p>

<p>"God keep you," said the old man; "whence
come you?"</p>

<p>"I am of King Arthur's court, and a Knight of
the Round Table, and am in quest of the Sangreal.
But here I find myself in a wilderness, with no
hope of escape."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>"Doubt not, if you be a true knight."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Percivale.</p>

<p>"I have come hither from a strange country to
comfort you," said the old man.</p>

<p>"Then, sir, can you tell me what my dream
signifies?" and Percivale related what had befallen
him.</p>

<p>"That can I," said the old man. "She that rode
on the lion betokens the new law of holy church,
and she came through love, to warn you of the
great battle that is before you."</p>

<p>"With whom shall I fight?" asked Percivale.</p>

<p>"With the strongest champion of the world, and
if you fail in the fight you shall not escape with the
loss of a limb, but shall be shamed to the world's
end. As for her that rode on the serpent, she
betokens the old law. Heed her not. The serpent
you slew betokens the devil that you rode hither,
and whom you overcame by the sign of the cross.
Yield not to her or any of her kindred, or worse
will befall you."</p>

<p>Then the ship turned and sailed away, leaving
Percivale again alone. But when he went up the
rocks he found there the lion, which he stroked
and made joyful fellowship with.</p>

<p>And thus time went on till midday. Then Percivale
saw a ship approaching with such speed as
if all the winds in the world had driven it. On
it kept till it reached land at the beach below him.
He hurried hopefully to meet it, and saw that it
was covered with black silk, while on the deck
stood a lady of great beauty, who was dressed in the
richest apparel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>"What brought you into this wilderness?" she
cried to the knight. "Here you are likely to die
of hunger, for no man may cross yonder rocks
and escape."</p>

<p>"I serve the best master in the world," said
Percivale. "He will not suffer harm to come to
me."</p>

<p>"Sir Percivale," said she, "know you who I
am?"</p>

<p>"Who taught you my name?" he answered.</p>

<p>"I know you better than you deem," she replied,
laughing. "This much I may tell you, that
not long since I was in the waste forest, where I
saw the red knight with the white shield."</p>

<p>"Ah! is that so? Fain would I meet with
him."</p>

<p>"I shall bring you to him; but only on covenant
that you will come to my aid when I summon
you."</p>

<p>"If it be in reason and uprightness, you may
trust me," he replied.</p>

<p>"I saw him," she continued, "chase two knights
into the stream that is called Mortaise, and follow
them into the water. But they passed over, and
his horse was drowned, and only by his great
strength he got safe to land again."</p>

<p>"That I am very glad to hear. It would have
been a sad day had that good knight been drowned."</p>

<p>"You look pale and thin," she remarked. "Have
you eaten lately?"</p>

<p>"Not these three days," he answered. "Yet I
spoke of late with a good man, whose words refreshed
me as if I had partaken of rich viands."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>"Ah, sir knight," she said, "beware of that old
man. I know him better than you. He is a false
enchanter, who seeks your harm. If you heed his
words shame will be your lot, and you will die on
this rock and be devoured by wild beasts. I am
here to help you in your need, for I am not content
to see so good a knight come to harm and disgrace."</p>

<p>"Who are you," asked Percivale, "that proffer
me so great a kindness?"</p>

<p>"Once I was the richest woman in the world,"
she answered. "Now I am disinherited and in
want."</p>

<p>"Then I pity you greatly. Who is it that has
disinherited you?"</p>

<p>"I dwelt with the greatest man in the world,"
she answered, "and to him I owe my beauty,&mdash;a
beauty of which I was, alas! too proud. Then I
said that which offended him deeply, and he drove
me away from him, and robbed me of my heritage,
and has never since had pity for me nor for my
friends. Since this has happened I have done my
best to wean his men from him, and many of them
now cling to me, and I and they war against him
day and night. I know no good knight, nor good
man, but that I strive to win him to my side, and
all such I repay well for their services. For he
against whom I wage war is strong, and I need
all the aid to be had. Therefore, since I know
you for a valiant knight, I beseech you to help
me. A fellow of the Round Table cannot, under
his vow, fail any woman that is disinherited, and
that seeks his aid."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>"That is true, indeed," said Percivale, "and I
shall do all I can for you."</p>

<p>"You have my earnest thanks," she said.</p>

<p>Then, as the weather was hot, she called some
of her attendants, and bade them bring a pavilion
and set it up on the gravel near the sea-line.</p>

<p>"Sir knight," she said, "I pray you to rest here
in the heat of the day, while my attendants prepare
food for you."</p>

<p>He thanked her and laid aside his helm and
shield, and fell asleep within the pavilion, where
he slumbered long. When he awoke he asked her
if the food was ready.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered; "I have worked while
you slumbered."</p>

<p>Then a table was set within the pavilion, and
covered with a rich array of meats and drinks,
of which Percivale ate with great appetite, while
the lady sat opposite him with a very gracious
aspect. The wine he drank was the strongest that
had ever passed his lips, and its strength soon got
into his veins and heated his brain.</p>

<p>The lady now smiled graciously upon him, and
it seemed to him that he had never beheld so fair
a creature. Her beauty so worked upon his heated
blood, indeed, that he proffered her his love, and
prayed earnestly for hers in return.</p>

<p>When she saw his loving ardor, and that the
wine worked like fire in his blood, she said, with
a smile of witchery,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir Percivale, if I become yours, you must become
mine. I shall not grant you my love unless
you swear that henceforth you will be my true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
servant, and do nothing but what I shall command.
Will you thus bind yourself, as you are a true
knight?"</p>

<p>"That will I, fair lady, by the faith of my body."</p>

<p>"Then this I will say, that of all the knights
in the world you are he whom I most love. And
you may seal upon my lips the compact we have
made."</p>

<p>But when Percivale came towards her, to claim
the proffered kiss, which she offered with such
bewitching grace, by chance or through God's aid
he saw his sword, which lay on the ground at his
feet, and in its pommel a red cross, with the sign
of the crucifix therein. Then came to his mind the
promise he had made to the old man, and his
knightly vows, and with a pious impulse he raised
his hand and made the sign of the cross on his forehead,
the while his eyes were fixed on the lovely
face of the tempter before him.</p>

<p>As he did so her smile changed to a look of
deadly hate, and the loveliness of her face to a
hideous aspect, while in the same moment the pavilion
fell as before a great wind, and then vanished
in smoke and cloud.</p>

<p>Over the sea the wind rose and roared, and as
he looked he saw the ship battling with heaving
waves, while the water seemed to burn behind it.
On the deck stood the lady, who cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir Percivale, you have betrayed me! Beware,
proud knight, I shall have my revenge." Then
the ship drove out to sea, and vanished from his
sight.</p>

<p>But in a passion of remorse Percivale snatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
up the sword that lay before him, and crying,
"Since my flesh has been my master I will punish
it," he drove the naked blade through his thigh,
till the blood spouted out like a fountain.</p>

<p>"Wretch that I am, how nearly was I lost!"
he cried, in a torment of conscience. "Fair sweet
Father, Jesus Christ my Lord, let me not be shamed,
as I would now have been but for thy good grace.
Take this wound in recompense for what I have
done against thee, and forgive me my deep transgression,
I humbly pray thee."</p>

<p>But as he lay moaning and bleeding the wild
winds went down and the sea grew smooth, while
he saw coming from the Orient the ship with the
good man, on board, on beholding whom he fell into
a swoon.</p>

<p>When he awoke he found that his wound had
been dressed and the bleeding stopped. Beside him
sat the good man, who asked him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How hast thou done since I departed?"</p>

<p>"Weakly and wickedly enough," he answered.
"A witch beguiled me, and I nearly fell a victim
to her wiles."</p>

<p>"Knew you her not?"</p>

<p>"Only that I deem the foul fiend sent her here
to shame me."</p>

<p>"Worse than that, good knight. Your victory
is greater than you deem. That seeming woman
who deceived you was no less an adversary than
the master-fiend of hell, who has power over all
the lesser devils, and, had you yielded you had
been lost forever. For this is the mighty champion
against whom you were forwarned; he who
was once the brightest angel of heaven, and was
driven out by our Lord Christ for his sins, and
thus lost his heritage. But that the grace of God
was on your side you would have fallen before
this champion of evil. Take this, Sir Percivale,
as a warning and an example."</p>

<p>With these words the good man vanished away.
Then the mariners carried the wounded knight
on board their ship, and set sail, bearing him
rapidly away from that scene of temptation and
victory.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h4>THE STRANGE ADVENTURES OF SIR BORS.</h4>


<p>When Sir Bors parted from his companions, on
the quest of the Sangreal, not far had he gone
when he met a religious man riding on an ass,
whom he courteously saluted.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the good man.</p>

<p>"I am one of those knights who have set out in
quest of the Sangreal," said Bors. "I would fain
have your counsel in this high duty, for great
honor shall come to him who succeeds therein."</p>

<p>"That is true," said the good man. "He that
wins the Sangreal will be counted the best knight
and the purest soul among men. None can hope
to attain it except through cleanness of spirit."</p>

<p>Then they rode together till they came to a
hermitage. Here Bors went into the chapel with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
his companion, and confessed to him, and ate bread
and drank water with him.</p>

<p>"Now," said the good man, "I charge you that
you take no other food than bread and water till
you sit at the table where the Sangreal shall be."</p>

<p>"To that I agree. But how know you that I
shall ever sit there?"</p>

<p>"I know it, let that suffice; but few of your
comrades shall have that honor."</p>

<p>"All that God sends me will be welcome," said
Bors.</p>

<p>"Also, instead of a shirt, and in token of chastisement,
you shall wear this garment," and the
good man produced a scarlet coat, which Bors
promised to wear next his skin till the Sangreal
should be won.</p>

<p>Then, after further wholesome advice, he resumed
his armor and departed. He had gone but
a little way from the hermitage when he passed a
tree that was little more than an old and leafless
trunk, and on one of its boughs he saw a great bird,
surrounded by young that were nearly dead with
hunger. As, he continued to look at this strange
sight, the bird smote itself in the breast with its
sharp beak, and bled till it died among its young.
Then the young birds fed on their mother's blood,
and were revived thereby.</p>

<p>This to Bors seemed full of deep significance,
and he pondered deeply upon it as he rode onward.
By even-song he found himself near a strong and
high tower, where he asked shelter for the night,
and was hospitably welcomed.</p>

<p>When he had disarmed he was led to a richly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
furnished apartment, where he found a young and
fair lady, who welcomed him gladly to her tower,
and invited him to take supper with her.</p>

<p>The table was set with rich meats and many
dainties, but Bors forgot not the hermit's charge,
and bade an attendant to bring him water. In
this he sopped bread and ate it.</p>

<p>"How is this?" asked the lady in surprise.
"Like you not my meat?"</p>

<p>"Truly I do, madam; yet I may eat no other
food this day."</p>

<p>Then the lady was silent, for she feared to displease
him by questioning. After supper, while
they sat talking, a squire came, who said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Madam, you know well what is set for to-morrow.
You must provide a champion to fight
in your quarrel against Pridam le Noire, or your
sister will have this castle and all your lands."</p>

<p>"I know that," she said, with a deep sigh. "May
God save me from being robbed, for I see no earthly
aid."</p>

<p>Her sorrow touched Bors, who asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What means this, madam?"</p>

<p>"Sir," she said, "I shall tell you. There was
formerly a king named Aniause, who owned all
these lands. By chance he loved my sister, who
is much older than I,&mdash;and much wickeder also, I
fear. He gave her this land to govern; but she
brought into it many evil customs, and caused the
death of many of his kinsmen. When the king
saw how vilely she governed, he drove her away,
and put me over this district. But he is now dead,
and she is making war on me, and has destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
many of my men, and turned others from me,
so that I have little left but this tower, and the
few men that guard it. Even this she now threatens
to take from me, unless I can find a knight
to fight her champion, who will appear before my
gates to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Is it so?" said Bors. "Who is this Pridam le
Noire?"</p>

<p>"He is the most stalwart knight in this country,
and has no equal among us."</p>

<p>"Madam," said Bors, "you have given me shelter;
in return I shall aid you as far as I can in
your trouble. You may send word that you have
found a knight who will fight with this Pridam
the Black, in God's quarrel and yours."</p>

<p>"Then may God's blessing rest upon you," she
cried, gladly. And word was sent out that she
had found a champion who would take on himself
her quarrel.</p>

<p>That evening she did what lay in her power to
make Bors welcome, and sent him at bedtime to
a chamber whose bed was soft as down, and spread
with silken coverings.</p>

<p>But in no bed would he rest, but laid himself
on the floor, as he had vowed to do till he found
the Sangreal.</p>

<p>As he lay there asleep there came to him a vision.
He seemed to see two birds, one white as a swan,
the other of smaller size, and shaped like a raven,
with plumage of inky blackness. The white bird
came to him and said, "If thou wilt give me meat
and serve me, I shall give thee all the riches of
the world, and make thee as fair and white as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
am." Then the white bird departed, and the black
bird came and said, "I beg that you will serve me
to-morrow, and hold me in no despite; for this I
tell you, that my blackness will avail you more
than the other's whiteness." And this bird, too,
departed.</p>

<p>But his dream continued, and he seemed to come
to a great place, that looked like a chapel. Here
he saw on the left side a chair, which was worm-eaten
and feeble. And on the right hand were
two flowers of the shape of a lily, and one would
have taken the whiteness from the other but that
a good man separated them, and would not let
them touch. And out of each came many flowers
and plentiful fruit. Then the good man said,
"Would not he act with great folly that should
let these two flowers perish to succor the rotten
tree, and keep it from falling?" "Sir," said the
dreamer, "it seems to me that the flower is of
more value than the wood." "Then take heed
that you never choose the false for the true."</p>

<p>With this Bors awoke, and made the sign of
the cross on his forehead, and then rose and dressed.
When he had come to the lady she saluted him,
and led him to a chapel, where they heard the
morning service. Quickly afterwards there came
a company of knights that the lady had sent for, to
lead her champion to battle. After he had armed,
she begged him to take some strengthening food.</p>

<p>"Nay, madam," he answered, "that I shall not
do till I have fought this battle, in which I ask
but God's grace to aid me."</p>

<p>This said, he sprang upon his horse, and set out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
with the knights and men, closely followed by the
lady and her train. They soon came to where the
other party were encamped, and with them the lady
of their choice.</p>

<p>"Madam," said the lady of the tower, "you
have done me great wrong to take from me the
lands which King Aniause gave me. And I am
sorry that there should be any battle."</p>

<p>"You shall not choose," said the other, "unless
you withdraw your knight and yield the tower."</p>

<p>"That I shall not do. You have robbed me
enough already."</p>

<p>Then was the trumpet sounded, and proclamation
was made that whichever champion won the battle,
the lady for whom he fought should enjoy all the
land. This done, the two champions drew aside,
and faced each other grimly in their armor of proof.</p>

<p>But when the sound for the onset was blown
they put spurs to their steeds, which rushed together
like two lions, and the knights struck each
other with such force that their spears flew to
pieces and both fell to the earth.</p>

<p>They quickly rose and drew their swords, and
hewed at each other like two woodmen, so that
soon each was sorely wounded and bleeding profusely.
Bors quickly found that he had a sturdier
antagonist than he expected, for Pridam was a
strong and hardy fighter, who stood up lustily to
his work, and gave his opponent many a sturdy
blow.</p>

<p>Bors, perceiving this, took a new course, and
played with his antagonist till he saw that he was
growing weary with his hard work. Then he advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
upon him fiercely, and drove him step by
step backward, till in the end Pridam fell. Bors
now leaped upon him and pulled so strongly upon
his helm as to rend it from his head. Then he
struck him with the flat of his sword upon the
cheek, and bade him yield, or he would kill him.</p>

<p>"For God's love, slay me not!" cried the knight.
"I yield me to thy mercy. I shall swear never
to war against thy lady, but be henceforth her
friend and protector."</p>

<p>With this assurance, Bors let him live; while
the covetous old lady fled in fear, followed by all
her knights. The victorious champion now called
to him all those who held lands in that estate, and
threatened to destroy them unless they would do
the lady such service as belonged to their holdings.
This they swore to do, and there and then paid
homage to the lady, who thus came to her own
again through the mighty prowess of Sir Bors de
Ganis.</p>

<p>Not until the country was well in peace did he
take his leave, refusing the offers of wealth which
the grateful lady pressed upon him, and receiving
her warm thanks with a humility that well became
him.</p>

<p>Hardly would she let him go; but at length he
bade her farewell, and rode away from her tears
and thanks. On he journeyed for all that day,
and till midday of the next, when he found himself
in a forest, where a strange adventure befell
him.</p>

<p>For at the parting of two ways he met two
knights who had taken prisoner his brother Lionel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
whom they had bound all naked upon a hackney,
while they beat him with thorns till the blood
flowed from every part of his body. Yet so great
of heart was he that no word came from his lips,
and he made no sign of pain.</p>

<p>Bors, seeing this, was on the point of rushing
to his rescue, when he beheld on the other side a
knight who held as prisoner a fair lady, whom he
was taking into the thickest part of the forest to
hide her from those who sought her. And as they
went she cried in a lamentable voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Saint Mary, rescue me! Holy mother, succor
your maid!"</p>

<p>When she saw Bors she cried out to him grievously
for aid and rescue.</p>

<p>"By the faith you owe to the high order of
knighthood, and for the noble King Arthur's sake,
who I suppose made you knight, help me, gracious
sir, and suffer me not to come to shame through
this felon knight!"</p>

<p>On hearing this appeal the distracted knight
knew not what to do. On one side his brother in
danger of his life; on the other a maiden in peril
of her honor.</p>

<p>"If I rescue not my brother he will be slain;
and that I would not have for the earth. Yet if
I help not the maiden, I am recreant to my vows
of knighthood, and to my duty to the high order
of chivalry."</p>

<p>Tears ran from his eyes as he stood in cruel
perplexity. Then, with a knightly resolution, he
cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fair sweet Lord Jesus, whose liegeman I am,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
keep Lionel my brother that these knights slay
him not; since for your service, and for Mary's
sake, I must succor this maid."</p>

<p>Then he turned to the knight who had the damsel,
and loudly cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir knight, take your hands from that maiden
and set her free, or you are a dead man."</p>

<p>On hearing this the knight released the maiden
as bidden, but drew his sword, as he had no spear,
and rode fiercely at the rescuer. Bors met him
with couched spear, and struck him so hard a blow
as to pierce his shield and his hauberk on the left
shoulder, beating him down to the earth. On pulling
out the spear the wounded knight swooned.</p>

<p>"You are delivered from this felon. Can I help
you further?" said Bors to the maiden.</p>

<p>"I beg you to take me to the place whence he
carried me away."</p>

<p>"That shall I do as my duty."</p>

<p>Then he seated her on the knight's horse, and
conducted her back towards her home.</p>

<p>"You have done nobly, sir knight," she said.
"If you had not rescued me, five hundred men
might have died for this. The knight you wounded
is my cousin, who yesterday stole me away from
my father's house, no one mistrusting him. But
if you had not overcome him, there would soon
have been others on his track."</p>

<p>Even as she spoke there came a troop of twelve
knights riding briskly forward in search of her.
When they found her delivered their joy was great,
and they thanked Bors profusely, begging him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
accompany them to her father, who was a great
lord, and would welcome him with gladness.</p>

<p>"That I cannot do," said Bors, "much as I
should like to; for I have another matter of high
importance before me. I can but say, then, farewell,
and God be with you and this fair maiden."</p>

<p>So saying, he turned and rode briskly away,
followed by their earnest thanks. Reaching the
point where he had seen Lionel in custody, he took
the trail of the horses, and followed them far by
their hoof-marks in the road. Then he overtook
a religious man, who was mounted on a strong horse,
blacker than a berry.</p>

<p>"Sir knight," he asked, "what seek you?"</p>

<p>"I seek my brother," he replied, "who came
this way beaten by two knights."</p>

<p>"Then seek no further, but be strong of heart,
for I have sad tidings for you. Your brother is
dead."</p>

<p>He then led Bors to a clump of bushes, in which
lay a newly slain body, which seemed to be that
of Lionel. Seeing this, Bors broke into such grief
that he fell to the earth in a swoon, and long lay
there. When he recovered he said, sadly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear brother, I would have rescued you had
not a higher duty called me. But since we are thus
parted, joy shall never again enter my desolate
heart. I can now but say, be He whom I have
taken for my master my help and comfort."</p>

<p>Thus grieving, he took up the body in his arms,
and put it upon his saddle-bow. Then he said to
his companion,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Can you tell me of some chapel, where I may
bury this body?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>"Come with me. There is one near by."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 382px;">
<a name="Chapel_Pg_183" id="Chapel_Pg_183"></a><img src="images/p183.jpg" width="382" height="500" alt="AN OLD AND HALF-RUINED CHAPEL." title="AN OLD AND HALF-RUINED CHAPEL." />
<span class="caption">AN OLD AND HALF-RUINED CHAPEL.</span>
</div>

<p>They rode forward till they came in sight of a
tower, beside which was an old and half-ruined
chapel. Here they alighted, and placed the corpse
in a tomb of marble.</p>

<p>"We will leave him here," said the good man,
"and seek shelter for the night. To-morrow we
will return and perform the services for the dead."</p>

<p>"Are you a priest?" asked Bors.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered.</p>

<p>"Then you may be able to interpret a dream
that came to me last night."</p>

<p>Thereupon he told his dream of the birds, and
that of the flowers.</p>

<p>"I can interpret the vision of the birds now,"
said the priest. "The rest must wait till later.
The white bird is the emblem of a rich and fair
lady, who loves you deeply, and will die for love
if you pity her not. I counsel you, therefore, not
to refuse her, for this I shall tell you, that if you
return not her love, your cousin Lancelot, the best
of knights, shall die. Men will call you a man-slayer,
both of your brother Lionel and your cousin
Lancelot, since you might have saved them both
easily if you would. You rescued a maiden who
was naught to you, and let your brother perish.
Which, think you, was your greater duty?"</p>

<p>"I did what I thought my duty," said Bors.</p>

<p>"At any rate, bear this in mind, you will be in
sad fault if you suffer your cousin Lancelot to
die for an idle scruple."</p>

<p>"I should be sad, indeed," said Bors. "Rather
would I die ten times over than see my cousin Lancelot
perish through fault of mine."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>"The choice lies in your hand," said the priest.
"It is for you to decide."</p>

<p>As he spoke they came in front of a fair-showing
tower and manor-house, where were knights and
ladies, who welcomed Bors warmly. When he was
disarmed there was brought him a mantle furred
with ermine. Then he was led to the company
of knights and ladies, who received him so gladly,
and did so much to make his stay pleasant, that all
thoughts of his brother Lionel and of the danger
of Lancelot were driven from his mind.</p>

<p>As they stood in gay converse there came out of
a chamber a lady whom Bors had not before seen,
and whose beauty was such that he felt he had
never beheld so lovely a face, while her dress was
richer than Queen Guenever had ever worn.</p>

<p>"Here, Sir Bors," said those present, "is the
lady to whom we all owe service. Richer and fairer
lady the world holds not, and she loves you above
all other knights, and will have no knight but you."</p>

<p>On hearing this, Bors stood abashed. This, then,
he thought, was the white bird of his dream. Her
love he must return or lose Lancelot,&mdash;so fate had
spoken.</p>

<p>As he stood deeply thinking, the lady came up
and saluted him, taking his hand in hers, and bidding
him sit beside her, while her deep eyes rested
upon him with looks that made his soul tremble.
Never had he gazed into such eyes before.</p>

<p>Then she spoke of many things, luring him into
pleasant conversation, in which he forgot his fears,
and began to take delight in her presence. At the
end she told him how deeply and how long she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
loved him, and begged him to return her love, saying
that she could make him richer than ever was man
of his age.</p>

<p>These words brought back all his trouble of soul.
How to answer the lady he knew not, for his vow
of chastity was too deep to be lightly broken.</p>

<p>"Alas!" she said, "must I plead for your love
in vain?"</p>

<p>"Madam," said Bors, "I cannot think of earthly
ties and delights while my brother lies dead, and
awaits the rites of the Church."</p>

<p>"I have loved you long," she repeated, "both for
your beauty of body and soul, and the high renown
you have achieved. Now that chance has brought
you to my home, think not ill of me if I let you not
go without telling my love, and beseeching you to
return it."</p>

<p>"That I cannot do," said Bors.</p>

<p>At these words she fell into the deepest sorrow,
while tears flowed from her beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>"You will kill me by your coldness," she bewailed.
Then she took him by the hand and bade
him look upon her. "Am I not fair and lovely,
and worthy the love of the best of knights? Alas!
since you will not love me, you shall see me die of
despair before your eyes."</p>

<p>"That I do not fear to see," he replied.</p>

<p>"You shall see it within this hour," she said,
sadly.</p>

<p>Then she left him, and, taking with her twelve
of her ladies, mounted to the highest battlement
of the tower, while Bors was led to the court-yard
below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>"Ah, Sir Bors, gentle knight, have pity on us!"
cried one of the ladies. "We shall all die if you
are cruel to our lady, for she vows that she and
all of us shall fall from this tower if you disdain
her proffered love."</p>

<p>Bors looked up, and his heart melted with pity,
to see so many fair faces looking beseechingly down
upon him, while tears seemed to rain from their
eyes. Yet he was steadfast of heart, for he felt
that he could not lose his soul to save their lives,
and his vow of chastity in the quest of the Sangreal
was not to be broken for the delights of earthly
love.</p>

<p>As he stood, some of the maidens flung themselves
from the tower, and lay dead and bleeding at his
feet, while above he saw the fair face of the lady
looking down, as she stood balanced on the battlement,
like a fair leaf that the next wind would
sweep to certain death.</p>

<p>"God help me and guide me!" cried Bors in
horror. "What shall I do? Here earthly endurance
is too weak; I must put my trust in heaven."
And he made the sign of the cross on his forehead
and his breast.</p>

<p>Then came a marvel indeed. A roar was heard
as if thunder had rent the sky, and a cry as if all
the fiends of hell were about him. For the moment
he closed his eyes, stunned by the uproar. When
he opened them again all had gone,&mdash;the tower,
the lady, the knights, and the chapel where he had
placed his brother's body,&mdash;and he stood in the
road, armed and mounted, while only a broad, empty
plain spread before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>Then he held up his hands to heaven and cried
fervently: "Father and Creator, from what have I
escaped! It is the foul fiend in the likeness of a
beautiful woman who has tempted me. Only the
sign of the holy cross has saved me from perdition."</p>

<p>Putting spurs to his horse he rode furiously
away, burning with anxiety to get from that
accursed place, and deeply glad at his escape. As
he proceeded a loud clock-bell sounded to the right,
and turning thither he came to a high wall, over
which he saw the pinnacles of an abbey.</p>

<p>Here he asked shelter for the night, and was
received with a warm welcome, for those within
deemed he was one of the knights that sought the
Sangreal. When morning came he heard mass, and
then the abbot came and bade him good-morning.
A conversation followed, in which he told the abbot
all that had happened to him, and begged his
interpretation thereof.</p>

<p>"Truly you are strong in the service of the
Lord," said the abbot, "and are held for great
deeds. Thus I interpret your adventures and
visions. The great fowl that fed its young with
its own blood is an emblem of Christ, who shed
his blood for the good of mankind. And the bare
tree on which it sat signifies the world, which
of itself is barren and without fruit. Also King
Aniause betokens Jesus Christ, and the lady for
whom you took the battle the new law of Holy
Church; while the older lady is the emblem of the
old law and the fiend, which forever war against
the Church.</p>

<p>"By the black bird also was emblemed the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Church, which saith, 'I am black but he is fair.'
The white bird represented the fiend, which, like
hypocrisy, is white without and foul within. As
for the rotten chair and the white lilies, the first
was thy brother Lionel, who is a murderer and an
untrue knight; while the lilies were the knight and
the lady. The one drew near to the other to dishonor
her, but you forced them to part. And you
would have been in great peril had you, for the
rescue of a rotten tree, suffered those two flowers
to perish; for if they had sinned together they
had both been damned.</p>

<p>"The seeming man of religion, who blamed you
for leaving your brother to rescue a lady, was the
foul fiend himself. Your brother was not slain, as
he made it appear, but is still alive. For the
corpse, and the chapel, and the tower were all
devices of the evil one, and the lady who offered
her love was the fiend himself in that showing.
He knew you were tender-hearted, and he did all.
Much you may thank God that you withstood his
temptation, and that until now you have come
through all your adventures pure and unblemished."</p>

<p>This gladdened the heart of the virtuous knight,
and a warm hope of winning the Sangreal arose
in his soul. Much more passed between them, and
when Bors rode forth it was with the fervent blessing
of the holy abbot.</p>

<p>On the morning of the second day Bors saw
before him a castle that rose in a green valley, and
met with a yeoman, whom he stopped and asked
what was going on in that country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>"Sir knight," he answered, "there is to be held
a great tournament before that castle."</p>

<p>"By what people?" asked Bors.</p>

<p>"The Earl of Plains," was the answer, "leads
one party, and the nephew of the Lady of Hervin
the other."</p>

<p>With this the yeoman rode on, and Bors kept on
his course, thinking he might meet Lionel or some
other of his old comrades at the tournament. At
length he turned aside to a hermitage that stood
at the entrance to the forest. And to his surprise
and joy he saw his brother Lionel sitting armed
at the chapel door, waiting there to take part in
the tournament the next morning.</p>

<p>Springing from his horse, Bors ran up gladly,
crying, "Dear brother, happy is this meeting!"</p>

<p>"Come not near me!" cried Lionel, leaping to
his feet in a burst of fury. "False recreant, you
left me in peril of death to help a yelping woman,
and by my knightly vow you shall pay dearly for
it. Keep from me, traitor, and defend yourself.
You or I shall die for this."</p>

<p>On seeing his brother in such wrath Bors kneeled
beseechingly before him, holding up his hands, and
praying for pardon and forgiveness.</p>

<p>"Never!" said Lionel. "I vow to God to
punish you for your treachery. You have lived
long enough for a dog and traitor."</p>

<p>Then he strode wrathfully away, and came back
soon, mounted and with spear in hand.</p>

<p>"Bors de Ganis," he cried, "defend yourself,
for I hold you as a felon and traitor, and the untruest
knight that ever came from so worthy a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
house as ours. Mount and fight. If you will not,
I will run on you as you stand there on foot. The
shame shall be mine and the harm yours; but of
that shame I reck naught."</p>

<p>When Bors saw that he must fight with his
brother or die he knew not what to do. Again he
kneeled and begged forgiveness, in view of the love
that ought to be between brothers.</p>

<p>But the fiend that sought his overthrow had put
such fury into Lionel's heart that nothing could
turn him from his wrathful purpose. And when
he saw that Bors would not mount, he spurred his
horse upon him and rode over him, hurting him
so with his horse's hoofs that he swooned with the
pain. Then Lionel sprang from his horse and
rushed upon him sword in hand to strike off his
head.</p>

<p>At this critical moment the hermit, who was a
man of great age, came running out, and threw
himself protectingly on the fallen knight.</p>

<p>"Gentle sir," he cried to Lionel, "have mercy
on me and on thy brother, who is one of the
worthiest knights in the world. If you slay him,
you will lose your soul."</p>

<p>"Sir priest," said Lionel, sternly, "if you leave
not I shall slay you, and him after you."</p>

<p>"Slay me if you will, but spare your brother,
for my death would not do half so much harm as
his."</p>

<p>"Have it, then, meddler, if you will!" cried
Lionel, and he struck the hermit a blow with his
sword that stretched him dead on the ground.</p>

<p>Then, with unquenched anger, he tore loose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
lacings of his brother's helmet, and would have
killed him on the spot but for a fortunate chance.</p>

<p>As it happened, Colgrevance, a fellow of the
Round Table, rode up at that moment, and wondered
when he saw the hermit dead, and Lionel
about to slay his brother, whom he greatly loved.</p>

<p>Leaping hastily to the ground, he caught the
furious knight by the shoulders and drew him
strongly backward.</p>

<p>"What would you do?" he cried. "Madman,
would you kill your brother, the worthiest knight
of our brotherhood? And are you so lost to honor
as to slay any knight thus lying insensible?"</p>

<p>"Will you hinder me?" asked Lionel, turning
in rage. "Back, sirrah, or I shall slay you first
and him afterwards."</p>

<p>"Why seek you to slay him?"</p>

<p>"He has richly deserved it, and die he shall,
whoever says the contrary."</p>

<p>Then he ran upon Bors and raised his sword to
strike him on the head. But Colgrevance pushed
between them and thrust him fiercely backward.</p>

<p>"Off, you murderer!" he cried. "If you are
so hot for blood you must have mine first."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Lionel.</p>

<p>"I am Colgrevance, one of your fellows. Round
Table Knights should be brothers, not foes, but I
would challenge King Arthur himself in this
quarrel."</p>

<p>"Defend yourself, meddler," cried Lionel, rushing
upon him and striking him fiercely on the helm
with his sword.</p>

<p>"That shall I," rejoined Colgrevance, attacking
him in turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>Then a hot battle began, for Colgrevance was a
good knight, and defended himself manfully.</p>

<p>While the fight went on Bors recovered his senses,
and saw with a sad heart Colgrevance defending
him against his brother. He strove to rise and
part them, but his hurts were such that he could
not stand on his feet. And thus he sat watching
the combat till he saw that Colgrevance had the
worst, for Lionel had wounded him sorely, and he
had lost so much blood that he could barely stand.</p>

<p>At this juncture he saw Bors, who sat watching
them in deep anguish.</p>

<p>"Bors," he cried, "I am fighting to succor you.
Will you sit there and see me perish?"</p>

<p>"You both shall die," cried Lionel, furiously.
"You shall pay the penalty of your meddling,
and he of his treason."</p>

<p>Hearing this, Bors rose with aching limbs, and
painfully put on his helm. Colgrevance again
called to him in anguish,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Help me, Bors! I can stand no longer. Will
you let me die without lifting your hand?"</p>

<p>At this moment Lionel smote the helm from his
head, and then with another fierce blow stretched
him dead and bleeding upon the earth.</p>

<p>This murderous deed done, he ran on Bors with
the passion of a fiend, and dealt him a blow that
made him stoop.</p>

<p>"For God's love leave me!" cried Bors. "If I
slay you or you me, we will both be dead of that
sin."</p>

<p>"May God never help me if I take mercy on you,
if I have the better hand," cried Lionel, in reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>Then Bors drew his sword, though his eyes were
wet with tears.</p>

<p>"Fair brother," he said, "God knows my heart.
You have done evil enough this day, in slaying a
holy priest and one of our own brotherhood of
knights. I fear you not, but I dread the wrath
of God, for this is an unnatural battle which you
force upon me. May God have mercy upon me,
since I must defend my life against my brother."</p>

<p>Saying this, Bors raised his sword and advanced
upon Lionel, who stood before him with the wrath
of a fury.</p>

<p>Then would have been a most unholy battle, had
not God come to the rescue. For as they thus
stood defiant a voice came to them from the air,
which said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Flee, Bors, and touch him not, for if you do,
you will surely slay him."</p>

<p>And between them descended a cloud that gleamed
like fire, and from which issued a marvellous flame
that burned both their shields to a cinder. They
were both so affrighted that they fell to the earth,
and lay there long in a swoon.</p>

<p>When they came to themselves Bors saw that
his brother had received no harm. For this he
thanked God, for he feared that heaven's vengeance
had fallen upon him. Then came the voice again.</p>

<p>"Bors," it said, "go hence, and bear thy brother
company no longer. Take thy way to the sea where
Percivale awaiteth thee."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, brother," said Bors, "for what I
have done against you."</p>

<p>"God has forgiven you, and I must," said Lionel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
"It was the foul fiend that filled my soul with
fury, and much harm has come of it."</p>

<p>Then Bors rode away, leaving Lionel in the company
of those whom he had slain, and took the
most direct road towards the sea.</p>

<p>At length he came to an abbey that was near the
water-side. And at midnight as he rested there he
was roused from his sleep by a voice, that bade him
leave his bed and ride onward.</p>

<p>He started up at this, and made the sign of the
cross on his forehead; then took his harness and
horse, and rode out at a broken place in the abbey
wall. An hour or so brought him to the water-side,
and on the strand there lay awaiting him a
ship all covered with white samite. Bors alighted,
and leaving his horse on the stand entered the ship,
commending himself to Christ's fostering care.</p>

<p>Hardly had he done so before the sails spread,
as of themselves, and the vessel set out to sea so
fast that it seemed to fly. But it was still dark
night, and he saw no one about him. So he lay
down and slept till day.</p>

<p>When he awaked he saw a knight lying in the
middle of the deck, all armed but the helm. A
glance told him that it was Percivale de Galis, and
he sprang towards him with joy. But Percivale
drew back, asking him who he was.</p>

<p>"Know you me not?" asked Bors.</p>

<p>"I do not. But I marvel how you came hither,
unless brought by our Lord himself."</p>

<p>Then Bors took off his helm and smiled. Great
was Percivale's joy when he recognized him, and
long did they converse in gladness, telling each
other their adventures and temptations.</p>

<p>And so they went far over the sea, the ship taking
them they knew not whither, yet each comforted
the other, and daily they prayed for God's
grace.</p>

<p>"Now, that we two are together," said Percivale,
"we lack nothing but Galahad, the best of
knights."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h4>THE ADVENTURE OF THE MAGIC SHIP.</h4>


<p>After Galahad had rescued Percivale from the
twenty knights, he rode into a vast forest, through
which he journeyed for many days, meeting there
many strange adventures. Then fortune took him
past a castle where a tournament was in progress,
and where the men of the castle had so much the
worse of it that they were driven back to their
gates, and some of them slain. Seeing this, Galahad
rode to the aid of the weaker party, and did
marvellous deeds of arms, soon aiding them to drive
back their foes.</p>

<p>As it happened, Gawaine and Hector de Maris
were with the outer party, and when they beheld
the white shield with the red cross, they said to
one another,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That hewer of helms and shields is Galahad,
none less. We should be fools to meet him face to
face."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>Yet Gawaine did not escape, for Galahad came
at full career upon him, and gave him such a blow
that his helm was cleft, and so would his head
have been but that the sword slanted, and cut the
shoulder of his horse deeply.</p>

<p>Seeing Gawaine thus dealt with, Hector drew
back, not deeming it wise to meet such a champion,
nor the part of nature to fight with his
nephew. Galahad continued his onset till he had
beaten down all the knights opposed to him. Then,
seeing that none would face him, he turned and
rode away as he had come, none knowing whither
he, who had come upon them with the suddenness
of a thunder-clap, had gone.</p>

<p>"Lancelot du Lake told no less than the truth,"
declared Gawaine, bitterly, "when he said that, for
seeking to draw the sword from the stone, I would
get a sore wound from that same blade. In faith,
I would not for the best castle in the world have
had such a buffet."</p>

<p>"Your quest is done, it seems," said Hector.</p>

<p>"As for that, it was done before. You can still
seek the Sangreal if you will, but I shall seek my
bed; and I fear I shall stay there much longer than
I care to."</p>

<p>Then he was borne into the castle, where a leech
was found for him, while Hector remained with
him, vowing he would not leave till his comrade
was well.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Galahad rode on, leaving many a
groan and more than one sore head behind him,
and at night reached a hermitage near the castle of
Carbonek. Here he was welcomed by the hermit;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
but late at night, when they were asleep, a loud
knock came on the door, which roused the host.
Going to see who knocked at that untimely hour,
he found a lady at the door, who said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ulfin, rouse the knight who is with you. I
must speak with him."</p>

<p>This he did, and Galahad went to the door, and
asked her what she wished.</p>

<p>"Galahad," she replied, "I am sent here to seek
you. You must arm and mount your horse at once,
and follow me. Within three days I shall bring
you to the greatest adventure that ever knight met."</p>

<p>Without further question Galahad obeyed, and,
having commended himself to God, he bade his fair
guide to lead, and he would follow wherever she
wished.</p>

<p>Onward they rode during the remainder of the
night and the next day, till they came to a castle
not far from the sea, where Galahad was warmly
welcomed, for the damsel who guided him had been
sent by the lady of that castle.</p>

<p>"Madam," said the damsel, "shall he stay here
all night?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied; "only until he has dined,
and has slept a little. He must ride on until destiny
is accomplished."</p>

<p>So at early nightfall Galahad was called and
helped to arm by torchlight. Then he and the
damsel again took horse, and rode on at speed till
they suddenly found themselves at the ocean's brink,
with the waves breaking at their feet. And here lay
a ship covered with white samite, from which
manly voices cried,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>"Welcome, Sir Galahad. We have long awaited
you. Come on board."</p>

<p>"What means this?" asked Galahad of the damsel.
"Who are they that call?"</p>

<p>"No others than your friends and comrades,
Sir Bors and Sir Percivale. Here you must leave
your horse, and I mine, and both of us enter the
ship, for so God commands."</p>

<p>This they did, taking their saddles and bridles
with them, and making on them the sign of the
cross. When they had entered the ship the two
knights received them with great joy. And as
they stood greeting each other the wind suddenly
rose and drove the ship from the land, forcing it
through the waves at a marvellous speed.</p>

<p>"Whence comes this ship?" asked Galahad.</p>

<p>Then Bors and Percivale told him of their adventures
and temptations, and by what miracles
they had been brought on board that vessel.</p>

<p>"Truly," said Galahad, "God has aided you
marvellously. As for me, had it not been for the
lady who led me, I should never have found you."</p>

<p>"If Lancelot, your father, were but here," said
Bors, "then it would seem to me that we had all
that heart could wish."</p>

<p>"That may not be," answered Galahad, "unless
by the pleasure of our Lord."</p>

<p>As they conversed the ship suddenly ran between
two rocks, where it held fast, but where they could
not land for the raging of the sea. But just before
them lay another ship, which they could reach
without danger.</p>

<span class="caption">THE MAGIC SHIP.</span>
</div>

<p>"Thither we must go," said the lady, "and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
we shall find strange things, for such is the Lord's
will."</p>

<p>At this they approached the ship, and saw that
it was richly provided, but without man or woman
on board. And on its bow there was written in
large letters,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You who shall enter this ship, take heed of
your belief: for I am Faith, and bid you beware.
If you fail I shall not help you. He who enters
here must be of pure heart and earnest trust."</p>

<p>They stood looking earnestly at one another after
having read these words.</p>

<p>"Percivale," said the lady, "know you who I
am?"</p>

<p>"I do not," he replied. "Have I ever seen you
before?"</p>

<p>"Know, then, that I am your sister, the daughter
of King Pellinore. I love no man on earth as
I do you. I warn you, therefore, not to enter this
ship unless you have perfect belief in our Lord
Jesus Christ, for if your faith fails you aught here
you shall perish."</p>

<p>"Fair sister," he replied, "happy am I, indeed,
to know you. As for the ship, I shall not fail to
enter it. If I prove an untrue knight or a misbeliever,
then let me perish."</p>

<p>As they spoke, Galahad blessed himself and entered
the ship, and after him came the lady, and
then Bors and Percivale. On reaching the deck
they found it so marvellously fair and rich that
they stood in wonder. In the midst of the ship was
a noble bed; and when Galahad went thither he
found on it a crown of silk. Below this lay a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
sword, half drawn from its scabbard, the pommel
being of stone of many colors. The scales of the
haft were of the ribs of two beasts. One beast was
a serpent, known in Calidone as the serpent of the
fiend; and its bone had the magic virtue that the
hand which touched it should never be weary or
hurt. The other beast was a fish, that haunted
the flood of Euphrates, its name Ertanax; its bone
had the virtue that he who handled it should not
think on the joys and sorrows of his past life, but
only of that which he then beheld. And no man
could grasp this sword but the one who passed all
others in might and virtue.</p>

<p>"In the name of God," said Percivale, "I shall
seek to handle it."</p>

<p>But in vain he tried, he could not grasp the magic
hilt. No more could Bors, who attempted it in
his turn. Then Galahad approached, and as he
did so saw written on the sword in letters like
blood, "He who draweth me has peril to endure.
His body shall meet with shame, for he shall be
wounded to the death."</p>

<p>"By my faith, the risk is too great," said Galahad.
"I shall not set my hand to so fatal a blade."</p>

<p>"That you must," said the lady. "The drawing
of this sword is forbidden to all men, save you.
No one can draw back from that which destiny
commands."</p>

<p>Then she told a marvellous story of that strange
blade.</p>

<p>"When this ship arrived in the realm of England,"
she said, "there was deadly war between
King Labor and King Hurlame, who was a christened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Saracen. Here they fought one day by the
sea-side, and Hurlame was defeated and his men
slain. Then he fled into this ship, drew the sword
which he saw here, and with one stroke smote King
Labor and his horse in twain. But a fatal stroke
it proved, for with it there came harm and pestilence
to all this realm. Neither corn nor grass
would grow, fruit failed to ripen, the waters held
no fish, and men named this the waste land of the
two marches. Nor did King Hurlame escape.
When he saw the strange carving of the sword, a
craving came into his mind to possess the scabbard.
Entering the ship for that purpose, he thrust
the sword into the sheath; but no sooner had he
done so than he fell dead beside the bed. And
there his body lay till a maiden entered the ship
and cast it out, for no man could be found hardy
enough to set foot on that fatal deck."</p>

<p>The three knights on hearing this looked earnestly
at the scabbard, which seemed to them made
of serpent's skin, while on it was writing in letters
of gold and silver. But the girdle was poor and
mean, and ill suited to so rich a sword. The writing
was to this effect: "He who shall wield me
must be hardy of nature. Nor shall he ever be
shamed while he is girt with this girdle; which
must never be put away except by the hands of a
maiden and a king's daughter. And she, if she
shall ever cease to be a maid, shall die the most
villanous death that woman ever endured."</p>

<p>"Turn the sword," said Percivale, "that we may
see what is on the other side."</p>

<p>On doing so they found it red as blood, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
coal-black letters, which said: "He that shall praise
me most shall find me most to fail him in time of
great need; and to whom I should be most fair shall
I prove most foul. Thus is it ordained."</p>

<p>Then Percivale's sister told them the history of
the sword, which was a very strange and admirable
thing to hear. More than once had it been drawn
in modern times; once by Nancien, who afterwards
became a hermit, and in whose hands the sword
fell in half, and sorely wounded him in the foot.
Afterwards it was drawn by King Pellam, and it
was for this boldness that he was destined to be
deeply wounded by the spear with which Balin
afterwards struck him.</p>

<p>The knights now observed the bed more closely,
and saw that above its head there hung two swords.
With them were three strange spindles, one of
which was white as snow, one red as blood, and one
as green as emerald. As they gazed at them with
curious wonder, the damsel told a strange story
of the surprising things they had gazed upon. And
thus her story ran.</p>

<p>When mother Eve gathered the fruit for which
Adam and she were put out of Paradise, she took
with her the bough on which the apple grew. As
it kept fair and green, and she had no coffer in
which to keep it, she thrust it in the earth, where,
by God's will, it took root, and soon grew to a great
tree, whose branches and leaves were as white as
milk. But afterwards, at the time of Abel's birth,
it became grass-green. It was under this tree that
Cain slew Abel, and then it quickly lost its green
color, and grew red as blood. So it lived and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
thrived, and was in full life when Solomon, the
wise king, came to the throne.</p>

<p>It came to pass that, as Solomon studied over
many things, and, above all, despised women in
his heart and in his writings, a voice came which
told him that of his line would be born the Virgin
Mary, the purest and noblest of human kind, and
that afterwards would come a man, the last of his
blood, as pure in mind as a young maiden, and as
good a knight as Joshua of Israel. This revelation
he told to his wife, who had questioned him as to
the reason of his deep study.</p>

<p>"Sir," she said, "since this knight is to come, it
is our duty to prepare for him. Therefore, I shall
first have made a ship of the best and most durable
wood that man may find."</p>

<p>This was done by Solomon's command. When
the ship was built and ready to sail, she made a
covering for it of cloth of silk, of such quality
that no weather could rot it. And in the midst she
placed a great bed, of marvellously rich workmanship,
and covered with silk of the finest texture.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear lord," she said to Solomon,
"since this last knight of your lineage is to pass
in valor and renown all other knights that have
been before or shall come after him, therefore I
counsel you to go into the Temple of the Lord,
where is the sword of the great King David, your
father, which is of magic temper and virtue. Take
off the pommel of this sword and make one of
precious stones, skilfully wrought. And make a
hilt and sheath of great richness and beauty. As
for the girdle, leave that to me to provide."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>Solomon did as she advised, and she took the
sword and laid it in the bed; but when he looked
at it he grew angry, for the girdle was meanly
made of hemp.</p>

<p>"I have nothing," she said, "fit to make a girdle
worthy of such a sword. But when the time comes
a maiden will change this for a girdle worthy of
him that is to wear it."</p>

<p>This done, she went with a carpenter to the tree
under which Abel was slain.</p>

<p>"Carve me from this tree as much wood as will
make me a spindle," she said.</p>

<p>"Ah, madam," said he, "I dare not cut the tree
which our first mother planted."</p>

<p>"Do as you are bidden," she ordered. "Dare
not disobey me."</p>

<p>But as he began to cut the tree drops of blood
flowed out. Then he would have fled, but she made
him cut sufficient to form a spindle. Next she
went to the green and the white trees, which had
grown from the roots of the other, and bade him
cut as much from each of these. From this wood
were three spindles wrought, which she hung up at
the head of the bed.</p>

<p>"You have done marvellously well," said Solomon,
on seeing this. "Wonderful things, I deem,
shall come of all this, more than you yourself
dream of."</p>

<p>"Some of these things you shall soon know,"
she answered.</p>

<p>That night Solomon lay near the ship, and as
he slept he dreamed. There came from heaven, as
it seemed to him, a great company of angels, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
alighted in the ship, and took water that was
brought by an angel in a vessel of silver, and
sprinkled it everywhere. Then the angel came to
the sword and drew letters on the hilt, and on the
ship's bow he wrote, "You who shall enter this ship
take heed of your belief," and further as the knights
had read. When Solomon had read these words he
drew back, and dared not enter, and there soon
arose a wind which drove the ship far to sea, so
that it was quickly lost to sight. Then a low voice
said, "Solomon, the last knight of thy lineage shall
rest in this bed." With this Solomon waked, and
lo! the ship was gone.</p>

<p>This was the story that the fair damsel, Percivale's
sister, told to the knights, as they stood
curiously surveying the bed and the spindles. Then
one of them lifted a cloth that lay on the deck, and
under it found a purse, in which was a written
paper, telling the same strange story they had just
heard.</p>

<p>"The sword is here," said Galahad; "but where
shall be found the maiden who is to make the new
girdle?"</p>

<p>"You need not seek far," said Percivale's sister.
"By God's leave, I have been chosen to make that
girdle, and have it here."</p>

<p>Then she opened a box which she had brought
with her, and took from it a girdle that was richly
wrought with golden threads and studded with
precious stones, while its buckle was of polished
gold.</p>

<p>"Lo, lords and knights," she said, "here is the
destined girdle. The greater part of it was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
of my hair, which I loved dearly when I was a
woman of the world. When I knew that I was set
aside for this high purpose, I cut off my hair and
wrought this girdle in God's name."</p>

<p>"Well have you done!" cried Bors. "Without
you we would have learned nothing of this high
emprise."</p>

<p>Then the noble maiden removed the mean girdle
from the sword, and put upon it the rich one she
had brought, which became it wonderfully.</p>

<p>"By what name shall we call this sword?" they
now asked her.</p>

<p>"Its name is," she answered, "the sword with
the strange girdle; and that of the sheath is, mover
of blood. But no man with blood in him shall
ever see the part of the sheath that was made of
the tree of life."</p>

<p>Then she took the sword and girded it about Galahad,
fastening the golden buckle about his waist.</p>

<p>"Now reck I not though I die," she said, "for
I hold that I am one of the world's blessed maidens,
since it has been given to me to arm the worthiest
knight in the world."</p>

<p>After this they left the magic ship at her bidding,
and entered the one in which they had come.
And immediately there rose a great wind which
blew their vessel from between the rocks, and carried
it afar over the sea.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h4>HOW LANCELOT SAW THE SANGREAL.</h4>


<p>The ship that bore the three knights and the
maiden came ashore at length near a castle in
Scotland, where they landed. From here they journeyed
far, while many were their adventures, all
of which tried their virtue and belonged to the quest
of the Sangreal. In them all the sword with the
strange girdle proved of such marvellous worth
that no men, were they a hundred in number, could
stand before it.</p>

<p>Finally they came to a castle which had the
strange custom that every maiden who passed that
way should yield a dish full of blood. When they
asked the reason of this dreadful custom, they were
told,&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is in this castle a lady to whom the
domain belongs, and who has lain for years sick of
a malady which no leech can cure. And a wise
man has said that she can only be cured if she have
a dish full of blood from a pure virgin and a king's
daughter, with which to anoint her."</p>

<p>"Fair knights," said Percivale's sister, "I alone
can aid the sick lady, who must die otherwise."</p>

<p>"If you bleed as they demand, you may die,"
said Galahad. "Is not your life worth more than
hers?"</p>

<p>"This I answer," said she. "If I yield not my
blood there will be mortal war between you and
the knights of the castle to-morrow, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
men must die that one woman may not bleed.
If I die to heal the sick lady I shall gain renown
and do God's will, and surely one harm is better
than many. That you will fight for me to the
death, I know, but wherefore should you?"</p>

<p>Say what they would, she held to her will, and
the next morning bade the people of the castle
bring forth the sick lady. She lay in great pain
and suffering, and bent her eyes pleadingly on
the devoted maiden.</p>

<p>Then Percivale's sister bared her arm, and bade
them bleed her. This they did till a silver dish
was filled with her life blood. Then she blessed
the lady, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Madam, I have given my life for yours; for
God's love, pray for me!" and she fell in a swoon.</p>

<p>Galahad and his fellows hastened to stanch the
blood, but it was too late, her life was ebbing
fast.</p>

<p>"Fair brother Percivale," she said, "death is
upon me. But before I die I have this to tell you.
It is written that I shall not be buried in this
country. When I am dead, seek you the sea-shore
near by, and put my body in a boat, and let it go
where fortune bears it. But when you three arrive
at the city of Sarras, in Palestine, which you will
in God's good time, you shall find me arrived
there before you. There bury me in consecrated
soil. This further I may say, that there the holy
Grail shall be achieved, and there shall Galahad
die and be buried in the same place."</p>

<p>And as they stood there weeping beside her a
voice came to them, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>"Lords and comrades, to-morrow at sunrise you
three must depart, each taking his own way, and
you shall not meet again till adventure bring you
to the maimed king."</p>

<p>After that all was done as had been foreseen
and desired. The maiden died, and the same day
the sick lady was healed, through the virtue of
her blood. Then Percivale wrote a letter telling
who she was and what things she had done. This
he put in her right hand, and laid her body in a
vessel that was covered with black silk. The wind
now arose and drove it far from the land, while
all stood watching it till it was out of sight.</p>

<p>Then they returned towards the castle. But suddenly
a tempest of wind, thunder, and rain broke
from the sky, so furious that the very earth seemed
to be torn up. And as they looked they saw the
turrets of the castle and part of its walls totter
and fall, and in a moment come crashing in ruin
to the earth.</p>

<p>That night they slept in a chapel, and in the
morning rode to the castle, to see how it had fared
in the storm. But when they reached it they found
it in ruins, while of all that had dwelt there not
one was left alive. All of them, man and woman
alike, had fallen victims to the vengeance of God.
And they heard a voice that said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"This vengeance is for the shedding of maidens'
blood."</p>

<p>But at the end of the chapel was a church-yard
in which were threescore tombs, over which it
seemed no tempest had passed. And in these lay
all the maidens who had shed their blood and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
died martyrs for the sick lady's sake. On these
were their names and lineage, and all were of
royal blood, and twelve of them kings' daughters.</p>

<p>The knights turned away, marvelling much at
what they had seen and heard.</p>

<p>"Here we must part," said Galahad. "Let us
pray that we may soon meet again."</p>

<p>Then they kissed each other, and wept at the
parting, and each rode his own way into the forest
before them.</p>

<p>But we must now leave them and return to Lancelot,
whom we left sorely repentant of his sins.
After he departed from the hermitage he rode
through many lands and had divers adventures,
and in the end came to the sea-shore, beside which
he lay down and slept.</p>

<p>In his slumber, words came to his ear, saying,
"Lancelot, rise and take thine armor, and enter
into the first ship that thou shalt find." On hearing
these words he started up, and saw that all
about him was strangely clear, the skies giving
out a light like that of midday. Then he blessed
himself, and took his arms, and advanced to the
strand, where he saw a ship without sails or oars.
This he entered, as he had been bidden, and when
he was within it his heart was filled with such joy
as he had never before known.</p>

<p>Naught had he ever thought of or desired but
what seemed come to him now, and in his gladness
he returned thanks fervently to the Lord.</p>

<p>"I know not what has happened to me," he said,
"but such joy as I feel I never dreamed the human
heart could hold."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>Then he lay down and slept on the ship's deck,
and when he woke the night had passed and it
was broad day.</p>

<p>And in the ship he found a bed, whereon lay a
dead lady, with a letter in her right hand which
Lancelot read. From this he learned that the fair
corpse was that of Percivale's sister, together with
many of the strange things that had happened to
her and the chosen knights.</p>

<p>For a month or more Lancelot abode in this ship,
driven about the seas, and sustained by no food,
but by the grace of the Holy Ghost, for he prayed
fervently for God's aid night and morning.</p>

<p>At length came a night when the ship touched
the shore. Here he landed, being somewhat weary
of the deck. And as he stood on the strand he
heard a horse approach, and soon one rode by that
seemed a knight.</p>

<p>When he came to the ship he checked his horse
and alighted. Then, taking the saddle and bridle
from the horse, he turned it free and entered the
ship. Lancelot, in surprise, drew near.</p>

<p>"Fair knight," he said, "I know not who you
are or why you come. But since you seek passage
on my ship you are welcome."</p>

<p>The other saluted him in turn, and asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is your name? I pray you, tell me, for
my heart warms strangely towards you."</p>

<p>"My name is Lancelot du Lake."</p>

<p>"Then are we well met indeed. You are my
father."</p>

<p>"Ah! then you are Galahad?"</p>

<p>"Yes, truly," and as he spoke he took off his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
helm, and kneeled, and asked his blessing.</p>

<p>Joyful indeed was that meeting, and gladly there
father and son communed, telling each other all
that had happened to them since they left the court.
When Galahad saw the dead maiden he knew her
well, and told his father the story of the sword,
at which he marvelled greatly.</p>

<p>"Truly, Galahad," he said, "I never heard of
aught so strange, and can well believe you were
born for wondrous deeds."</p>

<p>Afterwards for nearly half a year the father
and son dwelt together within that ship, serving
God day and night with prayer and praise. Now
they touched on peopled shores, and now on desert
islands where only wild beasts abode, and perilous
and strange adventures they met. But these we
shall not tell, since they had naught to do with the
Sangreal.</p>

<p>But at length came a Monday morning when
the ship touched shore at the edge of a forest, before
a cross, where they saw a knight armed all in
white, and leading a white horse. He saluted them
courteously, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Galahad, you have been long enough with your
father. You must now leave the ship, and take
this horse, and ride whither destiny shall lead you
in the quest of the Sangreal."</p>

<p>Hearing this command, Galahad kissed his father,
and bade him farewell, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear father, I know not if we shall ever meet
again."</p>

<p>"Then I bid you," said Lancelot, "to pray to the
great Father that He hold me in His service."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>There came in answer a mysterious voice that
spoke these words,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Think each to do well; for you shall never
see each other till the dreadful day of doom."</p>

<p>This voice of destiny affected them greatly, and
they bade each other a tearful farewell, Lancelot
begging again the prayers of his son in his behalf.
Then Galahad mounted the white horse and rode
into the forest, while a wind arose which blew the
ship from shore, and for a month drove it up and
down the seas.</p>

<p>But at length came a night when it touched
shore on the rear side of a fair and stately castle.
Brightly shone the moon, and Lancelot saw an
open postern in which stood on guard two great
lions. As he looked he heard a voice.</p>

<p>"Lancelot," it said, "leave this ship and enter
the castle. There shalt thou see a part of that
which thou desirest."</p>

<p>Lancelot at this armed himself and went to the
gate, where the lions rose rampant against him.
With an instinct of fear he drew his sword, but
at that instant appeared a dwarf, who struck him
on the arm so sharply that the sword fell from
his hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, man of evil hope and weak belief," came
the mysterious voice, "trust you more in your
armor than in your Maker? Does He who brought
you here need a sword for your protection?"</p>

<p>"Truly am I reproved," said Lancelot. "Happy
am I to be held the Lord's ward and servant."</p>

<p>He took up his sword and put it in the sheath,
then made a cross on his forehead, and advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
to the lions, which raged and showed their teeth
as if ready to rend him in pieces. Yet with a bold
step and tranquil mien he passed between them
unhurt, and entered the castle.</p>

<p>Through it he went, room by room, passage by
passage, for every door stood wide and no living
being met him as he advanced. Finally he came
to a chamber whose door was closed, and which
yielded not to his hand when he sought to open
it. He tried again with all his force, but the door
resisted his strength.</p>

<p>Then he listened, and heard a voice that sang
more sweetly than he had ever heard. And the
words seemed to him to be, "Joy and honor be
to the Father of Heaven!"</p>

<p>Lancelot no longer sought to open the door, but
kneeled before it, feeling in his heart that the Sangreal
was within that chamber.</p>

<p>"Sweet Father Jesus," he prayed, "if ever I
did aught in thy service, in pity forgive me my
sins, and show me something of that which I seek."</p>

<p>As he prayed the door opened without hands,
and from the room came a light brighter than if
all the torches of the world had been there. He
rose in joy to enter, but the voice spoke sternly in
his ear,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Forbear, Lancelot, and seek not to enter here.
If you enter, you shall repent it dearly."</p>

<p>Then he drew back hastily, and looked into the
chamber, where he saw a table of silver, on which
was the holy vessel covered with red samite, with
angels about it, one of which held a burning candle
of wax, and one a cross. And before the holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
vessel stood a priest, who seemed to be serving the
mass. In front of the priest appeared to be three
men, two of whom put the youngest between the
priest's hands, who held him up high as if to show
him. Yet so heavy seemed the figure that the
priest appeared ready to fall with weakness, and
with a sudden impulse Lancelot rushed into the
room, crying, "Fair Lord Jesus, hold it no sin that
I help the good man, who seems in utmost need."</p>

<p>But as he rashly entered and came towards the
table of silver, a breath that seemed half fire smote
him so hotly in the face that he fell heavily to the
earth, and lay like one bereft of all his senses.
Then many hands seemed to take him up, and
bear him without the door, where he lay to all
seeming dead.</p>

<p>When morning dawned he was found there by
the people of the castle, who marvelled how he
got there, and could not be sure if he were dead
or alive. But they laid him in a bed, and watched
him closely, for days passed without signs of life
or death. At length, on the twenty-fifth day, he
gave a deep sigh, and opened his eyes, and gazed
in wonder on the people about him.</p>

<p>"Why have you wakened me?" he cried. "Why
left you me not to my blessed visions?"</p>

<p>"What have you seen?" they asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Such marvels as no tongue can tell nor ear
understand," he said. "And more had I seen but
that my son was here before me. For God's love,
gentlemen, tell me where I am."</p>

<p>"Sir, you are in the castle of Carbonek."</p>

<p>"I thank God of His great mercy for what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
have seen," he said. "Now may I leave the quest
of the Sangreal, for more of it shall I never see,
and few men living shall see so much."</p>

<p>These words said, he arose and dressed in new
clothing that they brought him, and stood in his
old strength and beauty before the people.</p>

<p>"Sir Lancelot!" they cried, "is it you?"</p>

<p>"Truly so," he answered.</p>

<p>Then word was brought to King Pellam, the
maimed king, who now dwelt in that castle, that
the knight who had lain so long between death
and life was Lancelot. Glad was the king to hear
this, and he bade them bring Lancelot to him.</p>

<p>"Long has my daughter Elaine been dead," he
said. "But happy she lived in having been loved
by you, and in the grace of her noble son Galahad."</p>

<p>"I was but cold to her," answered Lancelot,
"for she was a lovable lady. But in truth I have
been held from love and life's delights, for my
fate has not been my own to control."</p>

<p>For four days he abode at the castle, and then
took his armor and horse, saying that now his
quest of the Sangreal was done, and duty bade
him return to Camelot.</p>

<p>Back through many realms he rode, and in time
came to the abbey where Galahad had won the
white shield. Here he spent the night, and the
next day rode into Camelot, where he was received
with untold joy by Arthur and the queen.</p>

<p>For of the Knights of the Round Table who
had set out on that perilous quest more than half
had perished, and small was the tale of that gallant
fellowship that could now be mustered. So the
coming of Lancelot filled all hearts with joy.</p>

<p>Great was the marvel of the king when Lancelot
told him of what he had seen and done, and of the
adventures of Galahad, Percivale, and Bors.</p>

<p>"God send that they were all here again," said
the king.</p>

<p>"That shall never be," said Lancelot. "One
of them shall come again, but two you shall never
see."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h4>THE DEEDS OF THE THREE CHOSEN KNIGHTS.</h4>


<p>After Galahad left the ship and his father Lancelot,
he rode far and had many adventures, righting
many wrongs and achieving many marvels.
Among these he came to the abbey where was the
ancient King Evelake, who had laid blind three
hundred years, as we have elsewhere told.</p>

<p>The old king knew well that his deliverance
had come, and begged to be embraced by the pious
youth. No sooner had he been clasped in his
arms than his sight returned, and his flesh grew
whole and young.</p>

<p>"Now, sweet Saviour, my destiny is fulfilled;
receive thou my soul," he prayed.</p>

<p>As he said these words the soul left his body,
and the miracle of his fate was achieved.</p>

<p>Many days after this Galahad met Percivale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
and soon the two came upon Bors, as he rode out
of a great forest, that extended many days' journey
through the land.</p>

<p>And so they rode in glad companionship, with
many a tale of marvel to tell, till in time they
came to the castle of Carbonek, where they were
gladly received, for those in the castle knew that
the quest of the Sangreal was now wellnigh
achieved.</p>

<p>When evening approached, and the table for
supper was set, the mysterious voice that so often
had guided these knights spoke again.</p>

<p>"They that are not worthy to sit at the table
of Jesus Christ arise," it said; "for now shall the
worthiest be fed."</p>

<p>Then all arose save Eliazar, the son of King
Pellam, and a maid who was his niece, and the
three knights. But as they sat at supper nine
other knights, in full armor, entered at the hall
door, and took off their helmets and armor, and
said to Galahad,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, we have come far and in haste to be with
you at this table, where the holy meat shall be
served."</p>

<p>"If you are worthy, you are welcome," said
Galahad. "Whence come you?"</p>

<p>Three of them answered that they were from
Gaul, three from Ireland, and three from Denmark,
and that they had come thither at the bidding
of the strange voice.</p>

<p>So they all sat at table. But ere they began to
eat, four gentlewomen bore into the hall a bed,
whereon lay a man sick, with a crown of gold on
his head. Setting him down, they went away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>"Galahad, holy knight, you are welcome," said
he who lay in the bed, raising his head feebly.
"Long have I waited your coming, in pain and
anguish, since Balin, the good knight, struck me
the dolorous stroke. To you I look for aid and
release from my long suffering."</p>

<p>Then spoke the voice again: "There be those
here who are not in the quest of the Sangreal;
let them depart." And the son and niece of the
king rose and left the room.</p>

<p>Then there came suddenly four angels, and a
man who bore a cross and wore the dress of a bishop,
whom the angels placed in a chair before the silver
table of the Sangreal. In his forehead were letters
which said, "This is Joseph, the first bishop of
Christendom."</p>

<p>Next opened the chamber door, and angels entered,
two bearing wax candles, the third a towel,
and the fourth a spear that bled, the blood drops
falling into a silver vessel which he held in his
other hand. The candles were set on the table,
the towel spread upon the vessel, and the spear set
upright on this.</p>

<p>The bishop then said mass, at which other
strange signs were seen; for a figure like a child,
with a face that shone like flame, entered into the
bread of the sacrament. Then the bishop kissed
Galahad, and bade him kiss his fellows. This
done, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Servants of Jesus Christ, ye shall here be fed
on such meats as never knights tasted;" and with
these words he vanished.</p>

<p>But as they knelt in prayer before the table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
they saw come out of the holy vessel a man who
bore all the signs of the passion of Jesus Christ.
And he took up the vessel and bore it to Galahad
and to the other knights, who kneeled to receive the
sacrament; and so sweet was it that their hearts
marvelled and were filled with joy.</p>

<p>"Now have you tasted of Christ's own food," he
said, "and seen what you highly and holily desired.
But more openly shall you see it in the city of
Sarras, in the spiritual place. Therefore you must
go hence, for this night the holy vessel will leave
this realm, and will never more be seen here. To-morrow
you three shall go to the sea, where a ship
awaits you; and you must take with you the sword
with the strange girdle."</p>

<p>"Shall not these good knights go also?" asked
Galahad.</p>

<p>"Not so. They have seen all that is fitting to
them. As for you, two of you shall die in my
service, and the third shall return and tell what
he has seen."</p>

<p>Then he gave them his blessing, and vanished
from out their midst.</p>

<p>When they had somewhat recovered from the
weight of these marvels, Galahad went to the spear
that lay on the table, and touched the blood with
his fingers, and with it anointed the wounds of the
maimed king. And at this touch he started up
whole and strong, thanking God fervently for his
healing.</p>

<p>But he went not into the world again, but to a
monastery of white monks, where he became a man
of holy renown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>At midnight came a voice to the nine knights,
which said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My sons, and not my chieftains; my friends,
and not my warriors; go ye hence, and do well what
comes to you, in my service."</p>

<p>"Lord," they replied, "wilt thou vouchsafe also
to call us thy sinners? Thy servants we shall be
henceforth."</p>

<p>And they arose, armed, and departed, bidding
a solemn adieu to the three knights. When morning
dawned these three rose also, and rode till they
came to the sea. Here awaited them the ship wherein
they had found the sword and the three magic
spindles, and to their wonder and delight they
beheld in its midst the table of silver and the
Sangreal, which was covered with red samite.</p>

<p>It was a joyous company that sailed over the sea
in that magical ship, and at the wish of his comrades
Galahad slept in the bed where the sword
had lain, and Bors and Percivale on the deck
beside him.</p>

<p>And so they went by day and by night, and at
length came to the city of Sarras. Here, as they
would have landed, they saw beside them, just
come to shore, the ship that bore the corpse of
Percivale's sister, and this as fair and as fresh as
when first placed within it.</p>

<p>Then they took up the silver table and bore it
to the city, at whose gate sat an old and crooked
cripple.</p>

<p>"Come hither, and help us carry this heavy
thing," said Galahad.</p>

<p>"How shall I do that? I have not gone for ten
years without crutches."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>"No matter for that. Show your good will by
trying."</p>

<p>Then the cripple rose and took hold, and in
that instant he was whole and strong, and helped
them bear the table to the palace. This done, they
returned, and bore to the palace the corpse of
Percivale's sister, which they placed in a rich tomb,
suited to a king's daughter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the report had spread through the
city that a cripple had been made whole by three
strange knights, and people flocked to see them.</p>

<p>When the king of the city saw and heard all
this, he came to the knights and asked them who
they were, and what it was they had brought into
his realm.</p>

<p>Galahad answered him, telling of the marvel
of the Sangreal, and of God's power and grace
therein.</p>

<p>But the king, Estorause, a tyrant in will and a
pagan in faith, heard this with wrath and unbelief,
and ordered the knights to be put in prison
as spies and felons.</p>

<p>For a whole year they lay thus in prison, yet
were always kept whole and in good spirits; for
the holy Sangreal came to them in their dungeons,
and filled their souls with joy. When the year
ended, Estorause grew sick unto death, and in
remorse sent for the imprisoned knights, whose
pardon and forgiveness he fervently begged. This
they gave him, and he straightway died.</p>

<p>His death threw the city into dismay, for he
had left no successor to the throne. But as the
lords sat in council there came a voice that bade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
them choose the youngest of the three knights for
their king. This mysterious behest was told to the
citizens, and with one acclaim they hailed it as
God's will, and demanded Galahad as their king.</p>

<p>Thereupon he became king of Sarras, though it
was not his wish; but he felt it to be God's command.
And when he came to the throne he had
constructed a chest of gold and precious stones, in
which was placed the table of silver with the holy
vessel, and before this the three knights kneeled
and prayed daily with fervent zeal.</p>

<p>And so time rolled on till came the day that was
the anniversary of that in which Galahad had
taken the crown. On this morning he rose betimes,
and before the holy vessel he saw a man dressed
like a bishop, while round about him was a great
fellowship of angels.</p>

<p>"Come forth, thou servant of Jesus Christ, and
thou shalt see what thou hast so much desired,"
said the bishop.</p>

<p>Then Galahad began to tremble, his flesh quaking
in the presence of things spiritual. And he
held his hands up towards heaven, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lord, I thank thee, for now my desire is fulfilled.
And if it be thy will that I should come
to thee, I wish no longer to live."</p>

<p>"I am Joseph of Arimathea," said the strange
presence, "and am sent by the Lord to bear thee
fellowship. Thou resemblest me in two things;
for thou hast seen the highest marvel of the Sangreal,
and are pure of heart and of body. Now
say farewell to thy comrades, for thy time is come
to depart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>Galahad thereupon went to Percivale and Bors,
and kissed them, and commended them to God,
saying to Bors,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fair friend, who art destined to return to our
native realm, salute for me my lord and father
Lancelot, and bid him remember the evils of this
unstable world, and bear in mind the duty he has
been taught."</p>

<p>Then he kneeled before the table and prayed
fervently, and suddenly his soul departed from his
body, a multitude of angels bearing it visibly upward
toward heaven, in full view of his late comrades.
Also they saw come from heaven a hand,
with no body visible, and take up the holy vessel and
the spear, and bear them to heaven. And from
that moment no man ever saw on earth again the
blessed Sangreal.</p>

<p>Afterwards Galahad's body was buried with great
honor, and with many tears from his two fellows
and from the people whom he had governed. Then
Percivale betook him to a hermitage, and entered
upon a religious life; while Bors stayed with him,
but in secular clothing, for it was his purpose to
return to England.</p>

<p>For a year and two months Percivale lived thus
the holy life of a hermit, and then he passed out of
this world, and was buried by Bors&mdash;who mourned
him as deeply as ever man was mourned&mdash;beside
his sister and Galahad. This pious office performed,
Sir Bors, the last of the three chosen knights, felt
that his duty in that land was at an end, and
thereupon took ship at the city of Sarras and sailed
for the realm of England, where he in good season<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
arrived. Here he took horse and rode in all haste
to Camelot, where King Arthur and the court then
were, and where he was received with the greatest
joy and wonder, for so long had it been since any
man there had set eyes on him, that all believed him
to be dead.</p>

<p>But greater than their wonder was their admiration
when the returned knight told the story of
miracle and adventure which had befallen him and
his two comrades, and the pious maid, Percivale's
sister, and of the holy life and death of Galahad
and Percivale. This marvellous narrative the king
had told again to skilled clerks, that they might
put upon record the wonderful deeds of these good
knights. And it was all written down in great
books, which were put in safe keeping at Salisbury.</p>

<p>Bors then gave to Lancelot the message which
his son had sent him, and Lancelot took him in his
arms, saying, "Gentle cousin, gladly do I welcome
you again. Never while we live shall we part, but
shall ever be true friends and brothers while life
may last to us."</p>

<p>And thus came to an end the marvellous and

<h3>THE LOVE OF LANCELOT AND GUENEVER.</h3>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h4>THE POISONING OF SIR PATRISE.</h4>


<p>After the quest of the Sangreal was ended, and
all the knights who were left alive had come again
to Camelot, there was great joy in the court, with
feasts and merrymakings, that this fortunate remnant
might find a glad welcome. Above all, King
Arthur and Queen Guenever were full of joy in
the return of Lancelot and Bors, both from the
love they bore them and the special honor they
had gained in the quest.</p>

<p>But, as is man's way, holy thoughts vanished
with the holy task that gave them rise, the knights
went back to their old fashions and frailties, and
in Lancelot's heart his earthly love for the queen
soon rose again, and his love of heaven and holy
thoughts grew dim as the days went by. Alas that
it should have been so! for such an unholy passion
could but lead to harm. To fatal ills, indeed, it
led, and to the end of Arthur's reign and of the
worshipful fellowship of the Table Round, as it is
our sorrowful duty now to tell.</p>

<p>All this began in the scandal that was raised
in the court by the close companionship between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Lancelot and the queen. Whisper of this secret
talk at length came to that good knight's ears, and
he withdrew from Queen Guenever as much as he
could, giving himself to the society of other ladies
of the court, with design to overcome the evil activity
of slanderous tongues.</p>

<p>This withdrawal filled the queen with jealous
anger, and she accused him bitterly of coldness in
his love.</p>

<p>"Madam," said Lancelot, "only that love for
you clung desperately to my heart, and drove out
heavenly thoughts, I should have gained as great
honor in the quest of the Sangreal as even my son
Galahad. My love is still yours, but I fear to show
it, for there are those of the court who love me not,
such as Agravaine and Mordred, and these evil-thinking
knights are spreading vile reports wherever
they may. It is for this I make show of delight
in other ladies' society, to cheat the bitter tongue
of slander."</p>

<p>To this the queen listened with heaving breast
and burning cheek. But at the end she burst into
bitter tears and sobs, and wept so long that Lancelot
stood in dismay. When she could speak, she
called him recreant and false, declared she should
never love him more, and bade him leave the court,
and on pain of his head never come near her again.</p>

<p>This filled the faithful lover with the deepest
grief and pain; yet there was anger, too, for he
felt that the queen had shut her ears to reason, and
had let causeless jealousy blind her. So, without
further words, he turned and sought his room, prepared
to leave the court. He sent for Hector, Bors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
and Lionel, and told them what had happened, and
that he intended to leave England and return to
his native land.</p>

<p>"If you take my advice you will do nothing so
rash," said Bors. "Know you not that women
are hasty to act, and quick to repent? This is not
the first time the queen has been angry with you;
nor will her repentance be a new experience."</p>

<p>"You speak truly," said Lancelot. "I will ride,
therefore, to the hermitage of Brasias, near Windsor,
and wait there till I hear from you if my lady
Guenever changes her mood. I pray you do your
best to get me her love again."</p>

<p>"That needs no prayer. Well you know I will
do my utmost in your behalf."</p>

<p>Then Lancelot departed in haste, none but Bors
knowing whither he had gone. But the queen
showed no sign of sorrow at his going, however
deeply she may have felt it in her heart. In
countenance she remained serene and proud, as
though the world went well with her, and her heart
was free from care.</p>

<p>Her desire, indeed, to show that she took as much
joy in the society of other knights as in that of
Lancelot led to a woful and perilous event, which
we have next to describe. For she gave a private
dinner, to which she invited Gawaine and his
brethren and other knights, to the number of
twenty-four in all. A rich feast it was, with all
manner of dainties and rare devices. Much was
the joy and merriment of the feasting knights.</p>

<p>As it happened, Gawaine had a great love for
fruits, especially apples and pears, which he ate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
daily at dinner and supper; and all who invited
him to dine took care to provide his favorite fruits.
This the queen failed not to do. But there was at
the feast an enemy of Gawaine's, named Pinel le
Savage, who was a cousin of Lamorak de Galis,
and had long hated Gawaine for the murder of
that noble knight.</p>

<p>To obtain revenge on him, Pinel poisoned some
of the apples, feeling sure that only Gawaine would
eat them. But by unlucky chance a knight named
Patrise, cousin to Mador de la Porte, eat one of the
poisoned apples. So deadly was the venom that in
a moment he was in agony, and very soon it so
filled his veins that he fell dead from his seat.</p>

<p>Then was terror and wrath, as the knights sprang
in haste and turmoil from their seats. For they
saw that Patrise had been poisoned, and suspicion
naturally fell upon the queen, the giver of the feast.</p>

<p>"My lady, the queen," cried Gawaine in anger,
"what thing is this we see? This fate, I deem, was
meant for me, since the fruit was provided for my
taste. Madam, what shall I think? Has this good
knight taken on himself the death that was intended
to be mine?"</p>

<p>The queen made no answer, being so confused
and terrified that she knew not what to say.</p>

<p>"This affair shall not end here," cried Mador de
la Porte in great wrath. "Here lies a noble knight
of my near kindred, slain by poison and treason.
For this I shall have revenge to the utterance.
Queen Guenever, I hold you guilty of the murder
of my cousin, Sir Patrise. I demand from the laws
of the realm and the justice of our lord the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
redress for this deed. A knight like this shall not
fall unrevenged, while I can wield spear or hold
sword."</p>

<p>The queen, at this hot accusation, looked appealingly
from face to face; but all stood grave and
silent, for greatly they suspected her of the crime.
Then, seeing that she had not a friend in the room,
she burst into a passion of tears, and at length fell
to the floor in a swoon.</p>

<p>The story of this sad business soon spread through
the court, and quickly came to the ears of the king,
who hastened to the banqueting hall full of trouble
at what he had heard. When Mador saw him, he
again bitterly accused the queen of treason,&mdash;as
murder of all kinds was then called.</p>

<p>"This is a serious affair," said the king, gravely.
"I, as a rightful judge, cannot take the matter
into my own hands, or I would do battle in this
cause myself, for I know well that my wife is
wrongly accused. To burn a queen on a hasty
accusation of crime is no light matter, though you
may deem it so, Sir Mador; and if you demand
the combat, fear not but a knight will be found to
meet you in the lists."</p>

<p>"My gracious lord," said Mador, "you must hold
me excused, for though you are our king, you are
a knight also, and held by knightly rules. Therefore,
be not displeased with me, for all the knights
here suspect the queen of this crime. What say
you, my lords?"</p>

<p>"The dinner was made by the queen," they answered.
"She or her servants must be held guilty
of the crime."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>"I gave this dinner with a good will, and with
no thought of evil," said the queen, sadly. "May
God help me as an innocent woman, and visit this
murder on the base head of him who committed
it. My king and husband, to God I appeal for
right and justice."</p>

<p>"And justice I demand," said Mador, "and require
the king to name a day in which this wrong
can be righted."</p>

<p>"Be it so, then," said the king. "Fifteen days
hence be thou ready armed on horseback in the
meadow beside Winchester. If there be a knight
there to meet you, then God speed the right. If
none meet you, then my queen must suffer the
penalty of the law."</p>

<p>When Arthur and the queen had departed, he
asked her how this case befell.</p>

<p>"God help me if I know," she answered.</p>

<p>"Where is Lancelot?" asked the king. "If he
were here, he would do battle for you."</p>

<p>"I know not," she replied. "His kinsmen say
he has left the land."</p>

<p>"How cometh it," said the king, "that you cannot
keep Lancelot by your side? If he were here
your case would be won. Sir Bors will do battle
in his place, I am sure. Go seek him and demand
his aid."</p>

<p>This the queen did, begging Bors to act as her
champion; but he, as one of the knights who had
been at the dinner, demurred, and accused her of
having driven Lancelot from the country by her
scorn and jealousy.</p>

<p>Then she knelt and begged his aid, and the king,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
coming in, also requested his assistance, for he was
now sure the queen had been unjustly defamed.</p>

<p>"My lord," answered Bors, "it is a great thing
you require of me, for if I grant your request I
will affront many of my Round Table comrades.
Yet for your and Lancelot's sake I will be the
queen's champion on the day appointed, unless it
may happen that a better knight than I come to
do battle for her."</p>

<p>"Will you promise me this, on your faith?"
asked the king.</p>

<p>"I shall not fail you," said Bors. "If a better
knight than I come, the battle shall be his. If not,
I will do what I can."</p>

<p>This promise gladdened the king and queen,
who thanked Bors heartily, and were filled with
hope, for they trusted greatly in this good knight's
prowess and skill.</p>

<p>Bors, however, had other thoughts than they
dreamed of, and left the court secretly, riding to
the hermitage of Brasias, where he found Lancelot
and told him of what had occurred.</p>

<p>"This happens well," said Lancelot. "The
queen shall not suffer. Do you make ready for
the battle, but tarry and delay, if I am not there,
as much as you may, till I arrive. Mador is a
hot knight, and will be hasty to battle. Bid him
cool his haste."</p>

<p>"Leave that to me," said Bors. "Doubt not that
it will go as you wish."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the news spread throughout the court
that Bors had taken on himself the queen's championship.
This displeased the most of the knights,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
for suspicion of the queen was general. On his
return many of his fellows accused him hotly of
taking on himself a wrongful quarrel.</p>

<p>"Shall we see the queen of our great lord King
Arthur brought to shame?" he demanded. "To
whom in the world do we owe more?"</p>

<p>"We love and honor our king as much as you
do," they answered. "But we cannot love a destroyer
of knights, as Queen Guenever has proved
herself."</p>

<p>"Fair sirs," said Bors, "you speak hastily, methinks.
At all times, so far as I know, she has
been a maintainer, not a destroyer, of knights,
and has been free with gifts and open-handed in
bounty to all of knightly fame. This you cannot
gainsay, nor will I suffer the wife of our noble
king to be shamefully slain. She is not guilty of
Sir Patrise's death, for she never bore him ill will,
nor any other at that dinner. It was for good
will she invited us there, and I doubt not her innocence
will be proved; for howsoever the game goeth,
take my word for it, some other than she is guilty
of that murder."</p>

<p>This some began to believe, convinced by his
words, but others still held their displeasure, believing
the queen guilty.</p>

<p>When at length the day that had been fixed for
the battle came, there was a great gathering of
knights and people in the meadow beside Winchester,
where the combat was to take place. But
many shuddered when they saw another thing, for
an iron stake was erected, and fagots heaped round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
it, for the burning of the queen should Mador win
the fight.</p>

<p>Such, indeed, was the custom of those days.
Neither for favor, for love, nor for kindred could
any but righteous judgment be given, as well upon
a king as upon a knight, upon a queen as upon a
poor lady, and death at the stake was the penalty
for those convicted of murder.</p>

<p>Now there rode into the lists Sir Mador de la
Porte, and took oath before the king that he held
the queen to be guilty of the death of Sir Patrise,
and would prove it with his body against any one
who should say to the contrary.</p>

<p>Sir Bors followed, and made oath as the queen's
champion that he held her guiltless, and would
prove it with his body, unless a better knight came
to take the battle on him.</p>

<p>"Make ready then," said Mador, "and we shall
prove which is in the right, you or I."</p>

<p>"You are a good knight, Sir Mador," said Bors,
"but I trust that God will give this battle to justice,
not to prowess."</p>

<p>He continued to talk and to make delay till
Mador called out impatiently,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It seems to me that we waste time and weather.
Either come and do battle at once, or else say nay."</p>

<p>"I am not much given to say nay," answered
Bors. "Take your horse and make ready. I shall
not tarry long, I promise you."</p>

<p>Then each departed to his tent, and in a little
while Mador came into the field with his shield on
his shoulder and his spear in his hand. But he
waited in vain for Bors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>"Where is your champion?" cried Mador to the
king. "Bid him come forth if he dare!"</p>

<p>When this was told to Bors he was ashamed to
delay longer, and mounted his horse and rode to
his appointed place. But as he did so he saw a
knight, mounted on a white horse, and bearing a
shield of strange device, emerge from a neighboring
wood, and come up at all speed. He continued his
course till he came to Sir Bors.</p>

<p>"Be not displeased, fair knight," he said, "if I
claim this battle. I have ridden far this day to
have it, as I promised you when we spoke last.
And for what you have done I thank you."</p>

<p>Then Bors rode to the king and told him that a
knight had come who would do battle for the queen
and relieve him from the championship.</p>

<p>"What knight is this?" asked the king.</p>

<p>"All I may say is that he covenanted to be here
to-day. He has kept his word, and I am discharged."</p>

<p>"How is this?" demanded Arthur. "Sir
knight, do you truly desire to do battle for the
queen?"</p>

<p>"For that, and that alone, came I hither," answered
the knight. "And I beg that there be no
delay, for when this battle is ended I must depart
in haste on other duties. I hold it a dishonor to
all those knights of the Round Table that they can
stand and see so noble a lady and courteous a queen
as Queen Guenever rebuked and shamed among
them all. Therefore I stand as her champion."</p>

<p>Then all marvelled what knight this could be,
for none suspected him. But Mador cried impatiently
to the king,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>"We lose time here. If this knight, whoever
he be, will have ado with me, it is time to end words
and begin deeds."</p>

<p>"You are hot, Sir Mador. Take care that your
valor be not cooled," said the other.</p>

<p>They now moved to their appointed stations, and
there couched their spears and rode together with
all the speed of their chargers. Mador's spear
broke, but the spear of his opponent held, and bore
him and his horse backward to the earth.</p>

<p>But he sprang lightly from the saddle, and drew
his sword, challenging the victor to do battle with
him on foot. This the other knight did, springing
quickly to the ground, and drawing his sword.
Then they came eagerly to the combat, and for the
space of near an hour fought with the fury of wild
beasts, for Mador was a strong knight, proved in
many battles.</p>

<p>But at last the strange champion struck his opponent
a blow that brought him to the earth. He
stepped near him to hurl him flat, but at that instant
Mador suddenly rose. As he did so he struck
upward with his sword, and ran the other through
the thick of the thigh, so that the blood flowed
freely.</p>

<p>When he felt himself wounded he stepped back
in a rage, and grasping his sword struck Mador
a two-handed blow that hurled him flat to the
earth. Then he sprang upon him to pull off his
helm.</p>

<p>"I yield me!" cried Mador. "Spare my life,
and I release the queen."</p>

<p>"I shall not grant your life," said the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
"only on condition that you freely withdraw this
accusation from the queen, and that no charge
against her be made on Sir Patrise's tomb."</p>

<p>"All this shall be done. I have lost, and adjudge
her innocent."</p>

<p>The knights-parters of the lists now took up Sir
Mador and bore him to his tent. The other knight
went to the foot of King Arthur's seat. By that
time the queen had come thither also, and was
heartily kissed by her overjoyed lord. Then king
and queen alike thanked the victor knight, and
prayed him to take off his helmet, and drink some
wine for refreshment. This he did, and on the
instant a loud shout went up from all present, for
they recognized the noble face of Lancelot du Lake.</p>

<p>"Sir Lancelot!" cried the king. "Never were
you more heartily welcome. Deep thanks I and
Queen Guenever owe you for your noble labor this
day in our behalf."</p>

<p>"My lord Arthur," said Lancelot, "I would
shame myself should I ever fail to do battle for
you both. It was you who gave me the high honor
of knighthood. And on the day you made me
knight I lost my sword through haste, and the
lady your queen found it and gave it me when I
had need of it, and so saved me from disgrace
among the knights. On that day I promised her
to be ever her knight in right or wrong."</p>

<p>"Your goodness merits reward," said the king,
"and therein I shall not fail you."</p>

<p>But as the queen gazed on Lancelot, tears came
to her eyes, and she wept so tenderly that she
almost sank to the ground from sorrow and remorse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
at her unkindness to him who had done her such
noble service.</p>

<p>Now the knights of his blood came around Lancelot
in the greatest joy, and all the Knights of
the Round Table after them, glad to welcome him.</p>

<p>And in the days that followed Lancelot was cured
of his wound, and Mador put under the care of
skilful leeches, while great joy and gladness reigned
in the court for the happy issue of that combat
which had promised so fatal an ending.</p>

<p>About this time it befell that Nimue, the damsel
of the lake, came to the court, she who knew so
many things by her power of enchantment, and
had such great love for Arthur and his knights.
When the story of the death of Sir Patrise and
the peril of the queen was told her, she answered
openly that the queen had been falsely accused,
and that the real murderer was Sir Pinel, who
had poisoned the apples to destroy Gawaine, in
revenge for the murder of Lamorak. This story
was confirmed when Pinel fled hastily from the
court, for then all saw clearly that Guenever was
innocent of the crime.</p>

<p>The slain knight was buried in the church of
Westminster, and on his tomb was written,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here lieth Sir Patrise of Ireland, slain by Sir
Pinel le Savage, through poisoned apples intended
for Sir Gawaine." And to this was added the story
of how Guenever the queen had been charged with
that crime, and had been cleared in the combat by
Sir Lancelot du Lake, her champion.</p>

<p>All this was written on the tomb, to clear the
queen's good fame. And daily and long Sir Mador
sued the queen to have her good grace again. At
length, by means of Lancelot, he was forgiven, and
entered again into the grace of king and queen.
Thus once more peace and good-will were restored
to Camelot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h4>THE LILY MAID OF ASTOLAT.</h4>


<p>It came to pass that, within fifteen days of the
Feast of the Assumption, King Arthur announced
that a great tournament would be held on that
day at Camelot, where he and the king of Scots
would hold the lists against all who should come.
This tidings went far, and there came to Camelot
many noble knights, among them the king of North
Wales, King Anguish of Ireland, the king with the
hundred knights, Sir Galahalt the high prince,
and other kings, dukes, and earls.</p>

<p>But when Arthur was ready to ride from London,
where he then was, to Camelot, the queen
begged to be excused from going with him, saying
that she was not well. Lancelot, too, would not
go, on the plea that he was not well of the wound
which Sir Mador had given him. So the king set
out in grief and anger, for the absence of his wife
and Lancelot tried him sorely. On his way to
Camelot he lodged in a town named Astolat, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
is now known as Gilford, and here he remained
for several days.</p>

<p>But hardly had he departed before the queen
sought Lancelot, and blamed him severely for not
going with the king, saying that he thus exposed
her to slander.</p>

<p>"Madam, your wisdom comes somewhat late.
Why gave you not this advice sooner?" said Lancelot.
"I will go, since you command it; but
I warn you that at the jousts I will fight against
the king and his party."</p>

<p>"Fight as you will, but go," said Guenever. "If
you take my counsel, however, you will keep with
your king and your kindred."</p>

<p>"Be not displeased with me, madam," said Lancelot.
"I will do as God wills, and that, I fear,
will be to fight against the king's party."</p>

<p>So the knight took horse and rode to Astolat, and
here in the evening he obtained quarters in the
mansion of an old baron, named Sir Bernard of
Astolat. It happened that this mansion was near
the quarters of the king, who, as in the dusk he
walked in the castle garden, saw Lancelot draw
near to Sir Bernard's door, and recognized him.</p>

<p>"Aha!" said the king, "is that the game? That
gives me comfort. I shall have one knight in the
lists who will do his duty nobly."</p>

<p>"Who is that?" asked those with him.</p>

<p>"Ask me not now," said the king, smiling.
"You may learn later."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lancelot was hospitably received by
the old baron, though the latter knew not his guest.</p>

<p>"Dear sir," said Lancelot to his host, "I thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
you for your kindness, and I shall owe you deeper
thanks if you will lend me a shield. Mine is too
well known, and I wish to fight in disguise."</p>

<p>"That shall I willingly," answered his host. "I
have two sons who were lately knighted, and the
elder, Sir Tirre, has been hurt. His shield you
shall have, for it is yet unknown in list or field.
As for my younger son, Sir Lavaine, he is a strong
and likely youth, whom I beg you will take with
you. I feel that you must be a champion of renown,
and hope you will tell me your name."</p>

<p>"Not at present, if you will excuse me," said
Lancelot. "If I speed well at the tournament I
will return and tell you. But I shall be glad to
have Sir Lavaine with me, and to use his brother's
shield."</p>

<p>"You are welcome to both," said Sir Bernard.</p>

<p>This old baron had a daughter of great beauty,
and in the freshness of youth, who was known
in that region as the Fair Maid of Astolat, by name
Elaine le Blank. And when she saw Lancelot her
whole heart went out to him in love,&mdash;a love of
that ardent nature that never dies while she who
wears it lives.</p>

<p>Lancelot, too, was strongly attracted by her fresh
young face, of lily-like charm; but he had no love
to give. Yet he spoke in tender kindness to the
maiden, and so emboldened her that she begged him
to wear her token at the tournament.</p>

<p>"You ask more than I have ever yet granted
to lady or damsel," said Lancelot. "If I yield to
your wish I shall do more for your love than any
woman born can claim."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 327px;">
<a name="Welcome_Pg_241" id="Welcome_Pg_241"></a><img src="images/p241.jpg" width="327" height="500" alt="&quot;YOU ARE WELCOME, BOTH!&quot; SAID SIR BERNARD." title="&quot;YOU ARE WELCOME, BOTH!&quot; SAID SIR BERNARD." />
<span class="caption">&quot;YOU ARE WELCOME, BOTH!&quot; SAID SIR BERNARD.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>She besought him now with still more earnestness,
and it came to his mind that if he wished to
go to the lists disguised he could take no better
method, for no one would recognise Lancelot under
a damsel's token.</p>

<p>"Show me what you would have me wear, fair
maiden," he said.</p>

<p>"It is a red sleeve of mine," she answered, "a
sleeve of scarlet, embroidered with great pearls,"
and she brought it to him.</p>

<p>"I have never done this for damsel before," said
Lancelot. "In return I will leave my shield in
your keeping. Pray keep it safe till we meet
again."</p>

<p>Then the evening was spent in merry cheer;
but that night Elaine slept but lightly, for her
slumber was full of dreams of Lancelot, and her
heart burned with fears that he might come to
harm in the lists.</p>

<p>On the next day King Arthur and his knights
set out for Camelot. Soon afterwards Lancelot and
Lavaine took leave of Sir Bernard and his fair
daughter, while the eyes of Elaine followed the
noble form of Lancelot fondly and far, as he rode.
Both the knights had white shields, and Lancelot
bore with him Elaine's red embroidered sleeve.
When they reached Camelot they took lodging privately
with a rich burgess of the town, that none
might know them.</p>

<p>When came Assumption Day, the lists were set,
the trumpets blew to the field, the two parties of
knights gathered promptly to the fray, and fierce
was the encounter between them. In the end, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
hard fighting, the party of Arthur bore back their
opponents, who were headed by the kings of Northumberland
and North Wales.</p>

<p>All this was seen by Lancelot and Lavaine, who
sat their horses at a distance looking on.</p>

<p>"Come," said Lancelot, "let us help these good
fellows, who seem to be overpowered."</p>

<p>"Lead on," said Lavaine. "I shall follow and
do my best."</p>

<p>Then Lancelot, with the red sleeve fastened upon
his helmet, rode into the thickest of the press, and
smote down such numbers of knights with spear
and sword that the party of the Round Table were
forced to give back, and their opponents came on
with fresh heart. And close upon Lancelot's track
Lavaine smote down several good knights.</p>

<p>"Who can this wonderful fighter be?" asked
Gawaine of the king.</p>

<p>"I know him well," said Arthur, "but will not
name him since he is in disguise."</p>

<p>"I could believe it was Lancelot," said Gawaine,
"but for that red sleeve. No man ever saw Lancelot
wear a woman's token."</p>

<p>"Let him be," said Arthur. "He will be better
known before he is done."</p>

<p>Then nine knights of Lancelot's kindred, angry
at seeing this one champion beat down all before
him, joined together and pressed hotly into the
din, smiting down all that opposed them. Three
of them&mdash;Bors, Hector, and Lionel&mdash;spurred together
on Lancelot, all striking him at once with
their spears. So great was their force that Lancelot's
horse was hurled to the ground, and his shield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
pierced by Bors, whose spear wounded him in the
side, breaking and leaving its head deep in the
flesh.</p>

<p>Seeing this misfortune, Lavaine spurred fiercely
on the king of the Scots, thrust him from his horse,
and, in despite of them all, brought that horse to
Lancelot, and helped him to mount. Then, though
so sorely hurt, Lancelot drew his sword, and, aided
by Lavaine, did such deeds of arms as he had never
surpassed in his hours of greatest strength. As
the chronicles say, that day he unhorsed more than
thirty knights; and Lavaine followed his example
well, for he smote down ten Knights of the Round
Table in this his first tournament. So does a noble
example stir young hearts.</p>

<p>"I would give much to know who this valiant
knight can be," said Gawaine.</p>

<p>"He will be known before he departs," answered
Arthur. "Trust me for that."</p>

<p>Then the king blew to lodging, and the prize was
given by the heralds to the knight with the white
shield who bore the red sleeve. Around Lancelot
gathered the leaders on his side, and thanked him
warmly for gaining them the victory.</p>

<p>"If I have deserved thanks I have sorely paid
for them," said Lancelot, "for I doubt if I escape
with my life. Dear sirs, permit me to depart, for
just now I would rather have repose than be lord
of all the world."</p>

<p>Then he broke from them and galloped away,
though his wound forced piteous groans from his
steadfast heart. When out of sight of them all he
checked his horse, and begged Lavaine to help him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
dismount and to draw the spear-head from his side.</p>

<p>"My lord," said Lavaine, "I would fain help
you; yet I fear that to draw the spear will be your
death."</p>

<p>"It will be my death if it remains," said Lancelot.
"I charge you to draw it."</p>

<p>This Lavaine did, the pain being so deadly that
Lancelot shrieked and fell into a death-like swoon,
while a full pint of blood gushed from the wound.
Lavaine stopped the bleeding as well as he could,
and with great trouble got the wounded knight to
a neighboring hermitage, that stood in front of a
great cliff, with a clear stream running by its foot.</p>

<p>Here Lavaine beat on the door with the butt of
his spear, and cried loudly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Open, for Jesus' sake! Open, for a noble
knight lies bleeding to death at your gate!"</p>

<p>This loud appeal quickly brought out the hermit,
who was named Baldwin of Brittany, and had once
been a Round Table knight. He gazed with pity
and alarm on the pale face and bleeding form before
him.</p>

<p>"I should know this knight," he said. "Who
is he?"</p>

<p>"Fair sir," said Lancelot, feebly, "I am a
stranger and a knight-errant, who have sought renown
through many realms, and have come here to
my deadly peril."</p>

<p>As he spoke the hermit recognized him, by a
wound on his pallid cheek.</p>

<p>"Ah, my lord Lancelot," he said, "you cannot
deceive me thus."</p>

<p>"Then, if you know me, help me for heaven's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
sake. Relieve me from this pain, whether it be by
life or death."</p>

<p>"I shall do my best," said the hermit. "Fear
not that you will die."</p>

<p>Then he had him borne into the hermitage, and
laid in bed, his armor being removed. This done,
the hermit stanched the bleeding, anointed the
wound with healing ointments, and gave Lancelot
a refreshing and healing draught.</p>

<p>Meanwhile King Arthur invited the knights of
both parties to a great evening feast, and there asked
the king of North Wales to bring forward the knight
of the red sleeve, that he might receive the prize he
had won.</p>

<p>"That I cannot do," was the answer. "He was
badly, if not fatally, wounded, and left us so hastily
that we know not whither he went."</p>

<p>"That is the worst news I have heard these seven
years," said Arthur. "I would rather lose my
throne than have that noble knight slain."</p>

<p>"Do you know him?" they all asked.</p>

<p>"I have a shrewd suspicion who he is; and I
pray God for good tidings of him."</p>

<p>"By my head," said Gawaine, "I should be sorry
enough to see harm come to one that can handle
spear and sword like him. He cannot be far away,
and if he is to be found I shall find him."</p>

<p>"Fortune aid you in the quest," said the king.</p>

<p>Then Gawaine took a squire, and they rode in all
directions for six or seven miles around Camelot,
but could learn nothing of the missing knight.
Two days afterwards Arthur and his fellowship set
out on their return to London. On their way they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
passed through Astolat, and here it happened that
Gawaine lodged with Sir Bernard, Lancelot's former
host.</p>

<p>He was well received, and the old baron and his
fair daughter begged him earnestly for tidings of
the tournament, being specially eager to know who
had done best there.</p>

<p>"Two knights bore all before them," said Gawaine.
"Both carried white shields, and one wore
on his helmet a red sleeve, as some fair lady's token.
Never saw I a man before do such mighty deeds,
and his fellow seconded him nobly."</p>

<p>"Blessed be God that that knight did so well,"
broke out Elaine, "for he is the first man I ever
loved, and shall be the last."</p>

<p>"You know him then?" said Gawaine. "Pray
tell me his name."</p>

<p>"That I know not, nor whence he came; but
this I truly know, that I love him, and that the
token he wore was mine. This, and this only, I
can justly affirm."</p>

<p>"This is a strange story," said Gawaine. "What
knowledge have you of him? and how came you
to know him?"</p>

<p>In response, she told him how the knight had
left his shield with her, and taken that of her
brother, with what else she knew.</p>

<p>"I would thank you much for a sight of that
shield," said Gawaine.</p>

<p>"I have it in my chamber, covered with a case,
and will send for it," said Elaine.</p>

<p>When the shield was brought Gawaine removed
the case, and at sight he knew it to be Lancelot's
shield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>"Ah, mercy!" said Gawaine, "the sight of this
makes my heart heavy."</p>

<p>"Why so?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"For good cause," he answered. "Is the owner
of this shield your love?"</p>

<p>"Truly so," she replied. "I love him dearly;
would to God he loved me as dearly."</p>

<p>"Then must I say that you have given your love
to the noblest and most renowned knight in the
world."</p>

<p>"So it seemed to me; for he carries a noble soul
in his face."</p>

<p>"This I may say," said Gawaine. "I have
known this knight for more than twenty years, and
never knew him before to wear a woman's token at
joust or tournament. You owe him thanks, indeed,
that he wore yours. Yet I dread greatly that you
will never see him again, and it is for this that my
heart is heavy."</p>

<p>"Why say you so?" she cried, starting up with
pallid face. "Is he hurt? Is he slain?"</p>

<p>"Not slain; but sadly hurt. This more it is my
duty to tell you: he is the noble knight, Sir Lancelot
du Lake. I know him by his shield."</p>

<p>"Lancelot! Can this be so? And his hurt&mdash;who
gave it? Is it really perilous?"</p>

<p>"Had the knight who wounded him known him,
he would have been grieved almost to death. As for
Sir Lancelot, I can tell you nothing more. On receiving
his hurt he left the lists with his comrade,
and cannot be found. He is somewhere concealed."</p>

<p>"Then shall I go seek him!" cried Elaine.
"Give me leave to do so, dear father, if you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
not have me lose my mind. I shall never rest till
I find him and my brother, and nurse him back
to health."</p>

<p>"Go, daughter, if you will," said her father, "for
I am sick at heart to hear such tidings of that noble
knight."</p>

<p>In the morning Gawaine rejoined King Arthur,
and told him of what he had learned.</p>

<p>"I knew already it was Lancelot," said the king;
"but never before knew I him to wear woman's
token."</p>

<p>"By my faith, this lily maiden of Astolat loves
him deeply," said Gawaine. "What it means I
cannot say, but she has set out to seek him, and will
break her heart if she fail to find him."</p>

<p>And so they rode on to London, where Gawaine
made known to the court that it was Lancelot who
wore the red sleeve and won the prize at the tournament.</p>

<p>This tidings made no small trouble in the court.
Bors and his kinsmen were heavy at heart when
they learned that it was Lancelot whom they had so
hotly assailed. And Queen Guenever was beside
herself with anger on learning that it was Lancelot
who had worn the red sleeve at the tournament.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Elaine journeyed to Camelot in search
of the wounded knight, and as she sought far and
near about the town, sick at heart, it chanced that
she espied her brother Lavaine, as he rode out to
give his horse air. She called loudly to him, and
when he came up asked him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How does my lord, Sir Lancelot?"</p>

<p>"Who told you, sister, that my lord's name was
Lancelot?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>She told him how she had learned this, and they
rode together to the hermitage, where Lavaine
brought her in to see the wounded knight.</p>

<p>But when she saw him lying there so sick and
pale, and with a death-like hue upon his face, she
stood gazing upon him with dilated eyes and whitening
face, and then suddenly fell to the floor in a
deep swoon.</p>

<p>"I pray you, Lavaine, take her up and bring her
to me," said Lancelot.</p>

<p>When she was brought near him he kissed her
pale face, and at the touch of his lips her cheeks
flamed out with red, and life came back to her.</p>

<p>"Fair maiden," said Lancelot, "it pains me to see
you so deeply afflicted. Comfort yourself, I pray
you. If you come here to my aid you are truly
welcome; but let not this little hurt trouble you;
I shall soon be well of it."</p>

<p>Then they fell into discourse, and Elaine told
Lancelot how Gawaine had seen and known his
shield. This gave him no small trouble, for he
knew well that the story of the red scarf would get
to Queen Guenever's ears, and he feared its effect
on her hasty and jealous temper. But Elaine never
left Lancelot, but watched him day and night,
nursing him back to health.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h4>HOW ELAINE DIED FOR LOVE.</h4>


<p>When Sir Bors learned that his unlucky blow
had brought Lancelot nearly to death's door, he
became sore indeed at heart, and hastened to Camelot
in search of his noble kinsman. Here he met
Lavaine, who knew him and conducted him to the
bedside of the wounded knight.</p>

<p>When he saw the pale and haggard countenance
of Lancelot, he fell into a passion of tears, and
accused himself bitterly. But Lancelot consoled
him as well as he could, declaring that the fault was
his own, and that he would bear the blame. Then
Bors told him of the anger of the queen, and of his
earnest but vain endeavor to overcome it.</p>

<p>"I deserve it not," said Lancelot. "I wore the
sleeve only by way of disguise. As for Gawaine, he
would have shown more wisdom and friendship had
he been less free of speech."</p>

<p>"I told her all this," said Bors, "but she was
past listening to reason. Is this maiden, who is so
busy about you, she whom they call the lily of
Astolat?"</p>

<p>"She it is," said Lancelot. "I cannot by any
means put her from me."</p>

<p>"Why should you?" asked Bors. "She is a
beautiful and tender-hearted damsel. Would to
God, fair cousin, you could love her, for I see well,
by her gentle and close care of you, that she loves
you devoutedly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>"That I am sorry for," said Lancelot.</p>

<p>"She will not be the first that has loved you in
vain," said Bors; "the more the pity."</p>

<p>Many other things they talked of, and Lancelot
found such comfort in the presence of Sir Bors that
in a few days he showed great signs of improvement.
Then Bors told him of another tournament that
King Arthur had ordered, to be held at Camelot on
All-hallowmas day, between his party and that of
the king of North Wales.</p>

<p>This filled Lancelot with an earnest desire to
grow strong, and during the following month, under
the kind care of his cousin, and the gentle ministrations
of Elaine, he improved greatly in health. For
Elaine waited upon him with loving diligence night
and day, and never was child or wife more gentle
and heedful to father or husband than this fair
maid of Astolat to the wounded knight.</p>

<p>At length came a day when Lancelot felt so much
stronger, through the healing influence of a bath of
herbs which the hermit had gathered in the woods,
that he determined to try if he could wear his armor
and sit in his saddle. He thereupon armed and
had his horse brought out. Mounting the mettled
charger, in the high spirit of new health he spurred
it to full speed.</p>

<p>But the courser's long rest in the stable had made
it fresh and fierce, and on feeling the spurs it leaped
forward so violently that Lancelot's wound burst
open in the strain, and the blood gushed out again.</p>

<p>"Bors! Lavaine! help!" he feebly cried. "I
am come to my end."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>As he spoke he fell from his horse to the earth,
and lay there like a corpse.</p>

<p>The two knights hurried up, full of fearful concern,
and when Elaine, who had heard the pitiful
call, came flying to the spot, she threw herself on
the prostrate form, weeping like one beside herself
with grief, and kissing the insensible knight as if she
hoped thus to recall him to life.</p>

<p>"Traitors you are!" she cried wildly to her
brother and Sir Bors. "Why did you let him leave
his bed? I hold you guilty of his death."</p>

<p>At this moment the hermit Baldwin appeared.
When he saw Lancelot in that plight he grew angry
at heart, though he checked the reproachful words
that rose to his lips.</p>

<p>"Let us have him in," he said, briefly.</p>

<p>Lancelot was thereupon carried to the hermitage,
his armor removed, and the bleeding stanched, but
it was long before he could be brought out of his
death-like swoon.</p>

<p>"Why did you put your life thus in jeopardy?"
asked the hermit, reproachfully, when the knight
was again in his senses.</p>

<p>"I was too eager to attend the tournament, now
near at hand," he said.</p>

<p>"Ah, Sir Lancelot, you have more courage than
wisdom, I fear. As for the tournament, let Sir
Bors attend it and do what he may. By the time
it is over and he returned, I hope that you may
be well once more, if you will but be governed by
my advice."</p>

<p>This advice was taken and Bors went to the tournament,
where he bore himself so valorously that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
the prize was divided between him and Gawaine.
Gareth and Palamides also did noble deeds, but they
departed suddenly before the prize was declared,
as if called away by some adventure.</p>

<p>All this Lancelot heard with great pleasure from
Bors on his return, his only regret being that he
had not been able to take part in that knightly
sport. But the remedies of the hermit and the care
of Elaine had meanwhile done him wonderful service,
and he was soon able again to mount his horse
and wear his armor in safety.</p>

<p>A day, therefore, quickly came when the knight
felt himself in condition for a journey, and when
he and his companions took the road to Astolat,
escorting the fair Elaine back to her father's home.
Here they were gladly received by the old baron
Bernard, and his son Tirre, who had now recovered.</p>

<p>But when the time approached which Lancelot
had set for his departure, Elaine grew pale and
drooping. At length, with the boldness of speech
of that period, she came to him and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord Sir Lancelot, clear and courteous sir,
will you then depart, and leave me alone with my
love and sorrow? Have mercy on me, I pray you,
and suffer me not to die of grief."</p>

<p>"What would you have me do?" asked Lancelot.</p>

<p>"I brought you back to life; give me your love
in return; make me your wedded wife, and I will
love you as never woman loved."</p>

<p>"That can I never do," said Lancelot, gravely.
"I shall never wed."</p>

<p>"Then shall I die for your love."</p>

<p>"Think not of death, Elaine. If I could marry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
woman it would be you, for I could love you dearly
were my heart free. For your gentleness and kindness
thus only can I repay you. If you can set
your heart upon some worthy knight who is free
to wed you, I shall give to you and your heirs a
thousand pounds yearly, as some small payment
of the debt I owe you."</p>

<p>"You speak idly and coldly, Sir Lancelot. Your
money I will have none of; and as for wedding, I
have but the choice to wed you or wed my death."</p>

<p>"You rend my heart, fair Elaine. Would that
it could be as you wish. Alas! that can never be."</p>

<p>At this, with a cry of heart-pain, the distressed
maiden fell swooning at his feet. Thence she was
borne by women to her chamber, where she lay,
lamenting like one whose heart is broken.</p>

<p>Sir Bernard now came to Lancelot, who was preparing
to depart, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear sir, it grieves me to find my daughter
Elaine in such a distressful state. I fear she may
die for your sake."</p>

<p>"It grieves me as deeply," said Lancelot. "But
what can I do? That she loves me so deeply I am
sorry to learn, for I have done nothing to encourage
it, as your son can testify. I know that she
is a true and noble maiden, and will do all that
I can for her as an honest knight; but love her as
she loves me I cannot, and to wed I am forbidden.
Yet her distress wounds me sorely."</p>

<p>"Father," said Lavaine, "I dare avow that she
is as pure and good as my lord Sir Lancelot has
said. In loving him she does but what I do, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
since I first saw him I could never depart from
him; nor shall I leave him so long as he will bear
my company."</p>

<p>Then Lancelot took his leave, and he and Lavaine
rode together to Camelot, where Arthur and the
whole court received the errant knight with the
utmost joy and warmest welcome. Queen Guenever
alone failed to greet him kindly, her jealous anger
continuing so bitter that she would not give him
a word or a look, seek as he would.</p>

<p>But the joy and brightness at Camelot were replaced
by darkness at Astolat, for the fair Elaine
was in such sorrow day and night that she neither
ate, drank, nor slept; and ever she sadly moaned
and bewailed the cruelty of Sir Lancelot.</p>

<p>Ten days of this brought her so near her end,
that her old father, with sad heart, sent for the
priest to give her the last sacraments. But even
then she made her plaints of Lancelot's coldness so
mournfully, that the ghostly father bade her cease
such thoughts.</p>

<p>"Why should I?" she cried. "Am I not a
woman, with a woman's heart and feelings? While
the breath is in my body I must lament my fate;
for I hold it no offence to love, and take God to
witness that I never have and never can love other
than Lancelot du Lake. Since it is God's will that
I must die from unrequited love of so noble a knight,
I pray for his mercy and forgiveness of all my sins.
Never did I offend deeply against God's laws; but
it was not in my nature to withstand the fervent
love that is bringing me to my death."</p>

<p>Then she sent for her father and brother, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
prayed them to write a letter as she might dictate.
This they did, writing down the mournful words
which she spoke.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, "this more I command you to
do. When I am dead, put this letter in my right
hand before my body grows cold. Then see that I
be richly dressed and laid in a fair bed, and take
me in a chariot to the river Thames. There lay
my body in a barge, covered with black samite, and
with but one man to steer the barge down the river
to Camelot."</p>

<p>All this they, weeping sadly, agreed to do, and
soon afterwards the maiden died, slain by her love.
Her sad old father then had all done as she had
requested.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Camelot the world moved merrily.
But one morning, by fortune, as King Arthur and
Queen Guenever stood talking at a window, they
espied a black barge drifting slowly down the river.
Wondering much what it meant, the king called
Sir Kay and two other knights, and sent them to the
river, bidding them to bring him speedy word of
what the barge contained.</p>

<p>This they did. On reaching the river-side they
found that the barge had been turned inward, and
lay beside the bank, and to their surprise they saw
in it a rich bed, on which lay the corpse of as fair
a woman as they had ever beheld. In the stern of
the barge sat, with oar in hand, a poor man who
seemed dumb, for no word would he speak.</p>

<p>"That corpse must I see," said the king, when
word of this event was brought him. "Surely this
betokens something strange."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>He took the queen by the hand and went to the
river-side with her. Here the barge had been made
fast, and they stepped from the shore to its deck.
There they saw the corpse of a beautiful maiden,
dressed in costly attire, and lying in a bed which
was richly covered with cloth of gold. And as she
lay she seemed to smile.</p>

<p>The queen now espied a letter clasped closely in
her right hand, and showed it to the king.</p>

<p>"That will surely tell us who she is, and why
she has come hither," he said.</p>

<p>He thereupon took the letter and returned with
the queen to the palace. Here, surrounded by many
knights, he broke the seal, and gave the epistle to a
clerk to read. This was its purport,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Most noble knight, Sir Lancelot, now hath
death made us two at debate for your love. I was
your lover, she whom men called the Fair Maid
of Astolat; therefore unto all ladies I make my
moan, and I beg you to pray for my soul, and at
the least to bury me, and offer my mass-penny.
This is my last request. God is my witness that
I die a pure maiden. Pray for my soul, Sir Lancelot,
as thou art peerless."</p>

<p>When this pitiful letter had been read, all who
heard it shed tears, for never had they heard aught
so moving. Then Lancelot was sent for and the
letter read to him.</p>

<p>"A sorrowful thing is this," he said, in grievous
tones. "Then she is dead, the fair Elaine, and
thus, with silent lips, makes her last prayer. Truly
it wounds me to the heart. Yet, my lord Arthur,
God knows I had no just share in the death of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
maiden, as her brother here, Sir Lavaine, can
testify. She was fair and good, and I owed her
much, but she loved me beyond measure, and her
love I could not return."</p>

<p>"You might have shown her," said the queen,
reprovingly, "some bounty and gentleness, and thus
have preserved her life."</p>

<p>"Madam," said Lancelot, "naught would she
have but my love, and my hand in marriage. I
offered to endow her with a thousand pounds yearly,
if she should love and wed any other, but to this
she would not listen. As for me, I had no other
comfort to give her, for love cannot be constrained,
but must rise of itself from the heart."</p>

<p>"Truly must it," said the king. "Love is free
in itself, and will not be bound, for if bonds be
placed upon it, it looseth itself perforce. As for
this unhappy maiden, nothing is left for you but
to obey her last pitiful request."</p>

<p>"That shall I to the utmost of my power," said
Lancelot.</p>

<p>Then many knights and ladies went to behold
the fair maiden, who had come thither in such moving
wise. And in the morning she was richly interred,
and with all due honor, at Lancelot's command;
and he offered her mass-penny, as did all
the knights who were there present.</p>

<p>Then the poor dumb servitor returned again with
the barge, rowing it slowly and sadly back to Astolat.</p>

<p>Afterwards the queen sent for Lancelot, and
begged his pardon humbly for her causeless anger.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Elaine_Pg_259" id="Elaine_Pg_259"></a><img src="images/p259.jpg" width="500" height="298" alt="ELAINE." title="ELAINE." />
<span class="caption">ELAINE.</span>
</div>

<p>"This is not the first time," said Lancelot, "that
you have been displeased with me without cause.
What you will, I must bear, and keep my sorrow
within my heart; yet I would that your love were
less tainted by hasty jealousy. As for forgiving you,
what else can I do, my queen? Love cannot live
without forgiveness."</p>

<p>After these events the winter and spring passed
on, with hunting and hawking, and jousts and
tournaments, and the fate of the fair Elaine was
wellnigh forgotten in the joy of the court. But
her brother Lavaine gained great honor, and at a
tournament that was given on Candlemas day did
so nobly that the king promised he should be made
a Knight of the Round Table at the next feast of
Pentecost.</p>

<p>And at this tournament Lancelot again fought
in disguise, wearing a sleeve of gold of the queen's,
and did such deeds that the prize was adjudged
to him. Thus a second time did he wear a woman's

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h4>THE CHEVALIER OF THE CART.</h4>


<p>The year passed on from Candlemas till after
Easter, and then came the month of May, when
every lusty heart begins to blossom and to bear
fruit; for as herbs and trees flourish in May, so
does the heart of a lover, since in this lusty month
all lovers gain courage, calling to their minds old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
vows and deeds of gentleness, and much that was
forgotten in the winter's chill.</p>

<p>As winter always defaces and erases green summer,
so fares it with unstable love in man and
woman. But as May flowers and flourishes in
many gardens, so flowers the lover's heart in the
joy of her to whom he has promised his faith. Yet
nowadays men cannot love seven days without their
love cooling; for where love warms in haste it cools
as hastily; thus fareth it in our days,&mdash;soon hot,
soon cold. The old love was not so. Men and
women could love together seven years in truth and
faithfulness. Such was the way of love in King
Arthur's days; but love nowadays I liken unto summer
and winter; now hot, now cold, like the changing
seasons. Therefore all ye who are lovers call
to your remembrance the month of May, like as did
Queen Guenever, who while she lived was a true
lover, and therefore she had a good end.</p>

<p>So it befell in the month of May that Queen
Guenever called unto her certain knights of the
Round Table, inviting them to ride with her in
the early morn a-maying in the woods and fields
beside Camelot.</p>

<p>"And see that you all be well horsed," she said,
"and clad in green, either in silk or cloth. I shall
bring with me ten ladies, and every knight shall
have a lady behind him, and bring with him a
squire and two yeomen."</p>

<p>And so, when morning came, the ten knights
invited put on their gayest robes of green, and
rode with the queen and her ladies, a-maying in
the woods and fields, to their great joy and delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>Yet this pleasure party led to sad results, as we
have now to tell. For there was a knight named
Meliagrance, son of King Bagdemagus, who had
a castle, the gift of King Arthur, within seven
miles of Camelot. This knight loved the queen,
and had done so for many years, and it had long
been in his heart to steal her away; but he had
never been able to find her without many knights
about her, and, chief of all, Sir Lancelot.</p>

<p>When he heard of this Maying party, and that
the queen would be attended by only ten knights,
and these in green robes, he resolved to carry out
his base design, and therefore placed in ambush
twenty men-at-arms and a hundred archers.</p>

<p>So it happened that while the queen and her
knights were merrily arraying one another in
flowers and mosses, and with wreaths made of
sprays of fresh green, this false knight rode suddenly
from a wood near by, followed by a throng
of armed men, and bade them stand, and yield up
the queen on peril of their lives.</p>

<p>"Traitor knight," cried Guenever, "what seek
you to do? Wouldst thou, a king's son, and a
knight of the Round Table, seek to dishonor the
noble king who made you what you are? You
shame yourself and all knighthood; but me you
shall never shame, for I had rather cut my throat
than be dishonored by you."</p>

<p>"Madam, this language will avail you nothing,"
said Meliagrance. "I have loved you many a year,
and now that I have you at advantage will take
you as I find you."</p>

<p>"You must kill us first, unarmed as we are,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
cried the queen's knights. "You have taken us
at a foul disadvantage; but you shall not have the
queen so lightly as you deem."</p>

<p>"Fight, will you? Then fight it, if you will
have it so," said Meliagrance.</p>

<p>Then the ten knights drew their swords, and the
others spurred upon them with couched spears.
But so skilfully did the queen's defenders use their
blades that the spears did them no harm.</p>

<p>The battle then went on with swords, and the
ten knights did noble deeds, slaying many of their
assailants; yet they were so overmatched that
they soon were all stretched upon the earth with
bleeding wounds.</p>

<p>"Sir Meliagrance," cried the queen, in deep distress,
"kill not my noble knights, I pray you. If
you do them no more harm I will go with you, if
you will take them with me. Otherwise I will
slay myself before you shall take me."</p>

<p>"Madam, since you wish it, they shall be taken
to my castle, whither you must come with me."</p>

<p>Then at the queen's command the battle ceased,
and the knights had their wounds dressed. But
Meliagrance watched keenly that none of the company
should escape, for greatly he feared that news
of this outrage might be borne to Lancelot du Lake.</p>

<p>But there was with the queen a little page who
rode a swift horse, and to him she privily spoke.</p>

<p>"Slip away, when you see the chance," she said,
"and bear this ring to Lancelot du Lake. Tell
him what has happened, and pray him as he loves
me to come in haste to my rescue. Spare not your
horse, and stay not for land or water."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>The page took the ring, and rode carelessly to
the edge of the circle. Then, seeing his opportunity,
he put spurs to his horse and rode away
at full speed. When Meliagrance saw this he ordered
instant pursuit, and the boy was hotly chased
and fired at with arrows and javelins; yet the speed
of his horse soon carried him beyond danger.</p>

<p>"Madam," cried Meliagrance, fiercely, to the
queen, "you are plotting to betray me. But if you
have sent for Lancelot du Lake, he shall find the
road to you a perilous one, I warrant him."</p>

<p>And as they rode to the castle he placed an
ambush of thirty archers by the road-side, charging
them if they saw a knight come that way on a
white horse to slay the horse. But he warned them
not to assail him in person, as they would find him
hard to overcome.</p>

<p>This done, the party proceeded to the castle;
but here the queen would not let her ladies and
knights out of her presence, and Meliagrance stood
in such dread of Lancelot that he dared not use
force.</p>

<p>In the mean time the page found Lancelot, and
gave him the queen's ring and message, telling
him the whole story of the treacherous assault.</p>

<p>"I would give all France to have been there well
armed," cried Lancelot. "The queen shall be
saved, or I will die in the effort. Haste you to
Sir Lavaine and tell him where I have gone, and
bid him follow me to Meliagrance's castle. Tell
him to come quickly, if he wishes to have a hand
in the rescue of the queen and her knights."</p>

<p>Lancelot was hastily arming as he spoke, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
mounting, he rode with all speed, forcing his horse
to swim the Thames in his haste. In no great
time he reached the spot where the fight had taken
place, and where he found the garlands the knights
had worn, rent with sword-strokes and reddened
with their blood. Then he followed the tracks of
the party till he entered a narrow passage, bordered
by a wood. Here were the archers stationed, and
when Lancelot came by they bade him return, for
that way was closed.</p>

<p>"Why should I turn?" he demanded. "Whence
get you the right to close the way?"</p>

<p>"If you go forward it will be on foot, for we
shall kill your horse."</p>

<p>"Go forward I shall, if there were five hundred
more of you," said Lancelot.</p>

<p>Then a cloud of arrows whistled through the
air, and the noble horse, struck by a dozen shafts,
fell to the earth. Lancelot leaped lightly from
the falling animal, and rushed in a rage into the
wood; but there were so many hedges and ditches
that he found it impossible to reach his light-armed
assailants.</p>

<p>"Shame on this Meliagrance for a dastard!" he
cried in anger. "It is a true old saw that a good
man is never in danger but from a coward."</p>

<p>The angry knight, finding that his assailants
were beyond his reach, set out on foot for Meliagrance's
castle, but found himself so encumbered
with his armor, shield, and spear, that his progress
was but slow. Yet he dared not leave any of his
arms, for fear of giving his foe an advantage.</p>

<p>At length, by good fortune, there appeared on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
the road a cart, that was used for hauling wood.</p>

<p>"Tell me, friend carter," said Lancelot, when
the vehicle came near, "what shall I give you for
a ride in your cart to a castle that lies a few miles
away?"</p>

<p>"You can give me nothing," said the carter.
"I am sent to bring wood for my lord, Sir Meliagrance,
and it is not my fashion to work for two
at once."</p>

<p>"It is Sir Meliagrance I seek."</p>

<p>"Then go on foot," said the carter, surlily. "My
cart is for other work."</p>

<p>Incensed at this, Lancelot dealt the fellow a
blow with his mailed fist that stretched him senseless
on the ground. Then he turned to the carter's
comrade.</p>

<p>"Strike me not, fair sir," pleaded this fellow.
"I will bring you where you wish."</p>

<p>"Then drive me and this cart to the gate of
Meliagrance's castle."</p>

<p>"Leap into the cart, and you shall be there
before the day grows old."</p>

<p>This Lancelot did, and the carter lashed his
horse forward with all speed, for he was in mortal
fear of the knight's hard fist.</p>

<p>An hour and a half afterwards, as Guenever
and her ladies stood in a window of the castle,
they saw a cart approaching, in which stood upright
an armed knight, resting on his spear. Even at
that distance they knew him by his shield to be
Lancelot du Lake.</p>

<p>"A noble and trusty friend he is, indeed, to
come in such a fashion," said the queen. "Hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
bested he must have been, to be forced to ride
hither in a woodman's cart."</p>

<p>As they looked, the cart came to the castle
gates, and Lancelot sprang from it to the ground,
his heart full of rage and passion.</p>

<p>"Where art thou, traitor?" he cried, in a voice
that rang throughout the castle. "Come forth,
thou disgrace to the Round Table fellowship! Come,
with all your men; for here am I, Lancelot du Lake,
who will fight you all single-handed on this
question."</p>

<p>As he spoke he thrust the gates open with such
force that the porter, who sought to hold them
shut, was hurled like a dead man to the earth.</p>

<p>When Meliagrance in the castle heard this loud
defiance his cowardly soul sank within him, for
well he knew from whom it came, and he ran in
haste to the queen and fell on his knees before
her, begging her to forgive him and to cool the
wrath of Lancelot. So pitifully did he implore,
that in the end Guenever was moved to compassion,
and went with her ladies to the castle court,
where Lancelot stood furiously bidding the traitor
knight to come down and do battle.</p>

<p>"Why are you so moved, Lancelot?" asked the
queen.</p>

<p>"Why should I not be?" he cried, in a rage.
"The hound has killed my horse and stolen my
queen. Is this the thing to bear like a lamb?"</p>

<p>"He sorely repents his fault, and has moved me
to forgive him," said the queen. "Come in, then,
peaceably, I beg you, for I have passed my word."</p>

<p>"You accord easily with this dog of a kidnapper,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
said Lancelot, sourly. "Had I looked for
this I might have spared my haste and saved my
horse."</p>

<p>"It is not through love or favor I have forgiven
him," said the queen, "but to check the voice of
scandal."</p>

<p>"I am no fonder of scandal than yourself," said
Lancelot. "Yet if I had my will I would make
this fellow's heart full cold before I left this castle."</p>

<p>"I know that well, but beg that you will be
ruled by me in this affair."</p>

<p>"Let it be so, if you have passed your word.
But you are too soft of heart Queen Guenever."</p>

<p>Then she took his hand, for he had taken off
his gauntlet, and led him into the castle, and to
the chamber in which lay the ten wounded knights,
whose hearts warmed at his coming. From them
he learned in full what had occurred, a story which
stirred his blood again into such a flame, that only
the soft hand of the queen hindered him from seeking
Meliagrance through the castle to slay him.</p>

<p>As they stood talking, Sir Lavaine rode furiously
in at the gate, crying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where is my lord, Sir Lancelot du Lake?"</p>

<p>"Here I am," cried Lancelot from a window.
"All is well, Lavaine."</p>

<p>"I found your horse slain with arrows, and
judged you were hard pushed."</p>

<p>"As for that, Lavaine, soft words have turned
hard blows. Come in. We shall right this matter
at another time, when we best may."</p>

<p>For many a day thereafter, as the French book
says, Lancelot was called the Chevalier of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
Cart, and many an adventure he had under that
homely name.</p>

<p>All went peacefully that night at the castle,
but the next morning there was new trouble. For
one of the castle maidens brought word to Meliagrance
that she had found what seemed to be the
print of a bloody hand on the coverings of the
queen's bed. Thither he hurried, full of jealous
anger, and found what appeared, indeed, to be the
crimson print of a man's hand. On seeing this
he made a loud outcry, declaring that it was the
blood of one of the wounded knights, and fiercely
accused Guenever of having been false to her lord
King Arthur.</p>

<p>When word of this accusation came to the
wounded knights they were filled with indignation,
and cried that they would meet Meliagrance or any
man in the lists in defence of the queen's honor.</p>

<p>"Ye speak proudly," said Meliagrance. "Yet
look here, and see if I have not warrant for what
I say."</p>

<p>When he showed them the red witness of his
words they were abashed, and knew not what to
answer.</p>

<p>All this was told to Lancelot, and he came in
haste and anger to the queen's chamber.</p>

<p>"What is this?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"It is that the queen has proved false to her
lord and husband, and this I stand ready to prove
with my body," said Meliagrance.</p>

<p>"Beware what you say, sir knight," cried Lancelot,
"or you will find your challenge taken."</p>

<p>"My lord Lancelot," answered Meliagrance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
"good knight as you are, take heed how you do
battle in a wrong quarrel, for God will have a hand
in such a cause."</p>

<p>"This I say," answered Lancelot, hotly, "that
you accuse the queen wrongly, and these noble
knights as falsely. This is the work of treason
or magic."</p>

<p>"Hold," said Meliagrance; "here is my glove,
in proof that she is traitress to the king, and that
one of these wounded knights is her leman."</p>

<p>"I accept your challenge," said Lancelot, "and
will fight you to the death in this cause. When
shall we do battle?"</p>

<p>"Let it be in eight days from this," said Meliagrance,
"in the field beside Camelot."</p>

<p>"I am agreed," said Lancelot.</p>

<p>"Then let us go to dinner," said Meliagrance,
"and afterwards you and the queen and her knights
may ride to Camelot."</p>

<p>Yet fairly as he spoke his heart was full of
treachery, and before going to the table he asked
Lancelot if he would care to see the rooms and
passages of the castle.</p>

<p>"If you wish to show them," said Lancelot.</p>

<p>Then they went from chamber to chamber, Lancelot
having no fear of peril or thought of treason.
But as they traversed a long and dark passage the
false-hearted host trod on a spring, and down fell
a trap-door, giving Lancelot a fall of more than
ten fathoms into a dark cell, whose floor was covered
deeply with straw. This done, Meliagrance
hastened away, after replacing the trap, and ordered
one of his men to remove Lavaine's horse
from the stable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>When the knights came to dinner all were surprised
that Lancelot was not present.</p>

<p>"Is this one of his old tricks?" asked the queen.
"He has a fashion of thus departing suddenly,
without warning."</p>

<p>"But not on foot," said Lavaine, and left the
room.</p>

<p>When he returned, it was to say that his horse
had vanished from the stable, and that doubtless
Lancelot had taken it and ridden off. So they sat
quietly at dinner, and afterwards set out for the
court, the wounded knights being carried under
care of Lavaine, in easily litters.</p>

<p>When the court was reached, and Arthur was
told of what had occurred, he was full of wrath.</p>

<p>"So this traitor Meliagrance chooses first to
kidnap my queen, and then to accuse her of treason?"
he cried. "By my crown, I would deal
with him in another fashion only that Lancelot
has taken the challenge. I fancy the fellow will
have his hands full, without my care. But where
is Lancelot?"</p>

<p>"That we know not," said the knights. "It is
like him to go off in this hasty way. He took Sir
Lavaine's horse, and left us without a word of
parting."</p>

<p>"Let him he," said the king. "He will come
in good time,&mdash;unless he be trapped by some
treachery."</p>

<p>Little dreamed they of Lancelot's true situation
at that moment. He had been sorely bruised by
his fall, and lay in great pain in the cave, visited
only by a lady, who came to him daily with food.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Yet it happened, as had occurred so often to
Lancelot, that the lady fell in love with his handsome
face. Meliagrance had made a foolish choice
in sending a woman with a soft heart to his prisoner,
and was likely to pay dearly for his folly.
Yet days passed on, and Lancelot continued deaf
to her sighs and blind to her languishing looks.</p>

<p>"Sir Lancelot," she at length said, "do you not
know that your lady, Queen Guenever, will be
burnt at the stake unless you be there at the day
of battle?"</p>

<p>"God forbid that such a disaster should come
to pass!" cried Lancelot. "Yet if I should not
be there, all men of worship will know that I am
dead, sick, or in prison, for men know me well
enough to know that nothing less would keep me
away. Therefore, some knight of my blood or of
my fellowship will take up this battle, and fight
bravely in the queen's cause."</p>

<p>"I shall set you free, Sir Lancelot, to fight your
own battle, if you will but give me your love; for
truly I love you with my whole heart."</p>

<p>"I am sorry that I cannot return it," said Lancelot.
"But I cannot lie to you in such a cause,
even for life or honor."</p>

<p>"Take heed what you say, Sir Lancelot. Shame
will be your lot if any but you fight this battle."</p>

<p>"As for the world's shame, may Christ defend
me. As for my distress of heart, it is welcome, if
God sends it."</p>

<p>The lady went away full of sorrowful thoughts.
But on the morning of the day fixed for the battle
she came to him again, and said, gently,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>"Sir Lancelot, I deem you hard-hearted and
cruel; yet I love you too truly to see you disgraced.
If you will solace my heart-pain with
but one kiss, I will set you free, and deliver to
you your armor, and the best horse in the castle
stables."</p>

<p>"Surely there is no dishonor in a kiss; and well
will you earn it by such service," said Lancelot.
"You offer me new life, fair lady."</p>

<p>Then he kissed her; and with a face half glad,
half gloomy, she led him from the prison by a
secret passage to the chamber where his armor
had been left. And when he was armed she conducted
him privily to a stable where stood twelve
good horses, and bade him make his choice.</p>

<p>Lancelot chose a white courser, whose size and
spirit pleased him most, and this he deftly saddled
and bridled. Then, with spear in hand and sword
by side, he commended the lady to God, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lady, for this good deed I shall do you ample
service if ever it be in my power. If not, may
God reward you."</p>

<p>This said, he rode with proud mien from the
castle, and galloped at headlong speed away, while
she, with sad eyes and sighing lips, stood looking
with loving regard on his departing form.</p>

<p>Sadly was his coming needed, for imminent was
the peril of the queen. At the place fixed for the
combat knights and lords had early gathered, and
Meliagrance, feeling sure that Lancelot could not
appear to do battle, put on a haughty mien, and
loudly demanded justice, or the combat. Yet the
hour appointed came and passed, and the queen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
champion had not appeared; while the king and all
the court grew full of pain and dread as the fatal
moments went by. The laws were strict, and could
not be set aside for queen or commoner. Guenever
must perish at the stake, or be saved by a champion's
sword and spear. Therefore, as the minutes
slowly grew into hours, and nothing of Lancelot
was seen, while Meliagrance more loudly demanded
justice or a champion, all hearts sank deep in
despair.</p>

<p>"My lord the king," cried Lavaine, at length,
"some sad misfortune has happened to Sir Lancelot.
Never did he fail to appear to do battle unless
he were sick or in prison. I beseech you,
therefore, give me leave this day to do battle for
him, and to strike a knightly blow for my lady the
queen."</p>

<p>"Thanks, gentle knight," said the king. "I
dare avow that the charge which Meliagrance lays
upon the queen is a false one, for of these ten
wounded knights who were present, there is not one
but would gladly do battle to prove its falsity were
he able to wear armor."</p>

<p>"That shall I do in the service of my lord
Lancelot," said Lavaine, "if you will give me
leave."</p>

<p>"Full leave you have," answered the king. "I
pray you do your best; for it seems sure that some
treachery has been done to the noble Lancelot."</p>

<p>Lavaine now armed in all haste, and, mounting
his war-courser, rode into the lists, where he faced
Meliagrance, challenging him to do battle to the
death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>"Lesses les aller!" cried the heralds.</p>

<p>The two champions couched their spears,
clutched their bridles, and were about to plunge
the spurs into their horses' flanks, when the sound
of hoofs was heard without, and an armed knight
came galloping at furious speed into the lists.</p>

<p>"Ho! and abide!" cried King Arthur.</p>

<p>"Raise your spears, sir knights, this quarrel is
mine," said the new-comer. "You have my thanks,
Lavaine, but only I must fight in this cause."</p>

<p>Then he rode to the king, lifted his visor, and
showed the noble face of Lancelot, now hot with
indignation.</p>

<p>"I am here to fight this villain and traitor," he
called, loudly. "My lord the king, I have lain
these eight days in a prison cell, into which the
base hound entrapped me. By fortune I escaped,
and here I am, ready to pay him in fitting coin for
his foul treachery."</p>

<p>"The dog! has he done this thing?" cried the
king, in anger. "Then, by my crown, whether he
win or not Guenever shall not suffer from the
charge which he has dared bring. But God's justice
will not let him win."</p>

<p>That Meliagrance quaked at heart on seeing this
seeming apparition from the grave need not be
said. But he had dared the hazard of the die,
and sat his horse in grim silence while his foul
treachery was thus made known to the court. Lancelot
now rode to his place in the lists, and faced
his adversary.</p>

<p>"Lesses les aller!" cried the heralds again.</p>

<p>Then, spear in rest, the warriors spurred their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
horses, and met with a shock like thunder in the
centre of the field. Lancelot kept his saddle, but
Meliagrance was hurled over his horse's croup.
Seeing this, Lancelot lightly sprang from his saddle,
drew his sword, and advanced upon his foe,
who was on his feet ready to meet him.</p>

<p>Hot and fierce was the combat that succeeded,
many great strokes being given and returned; but
at length Lancelot struck so fierce a blow that
Meliagrance was felled to the ground. Then the
dastard cried aloud in an agony of fear,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Noble knight, noble Sir Lancelot, spare my
life, I humbly pray you! I yield me as overcome
and recreant and beseech you, as a Knight and
Fellow of the Round Table, not to slay me helpless.
Alive or dead, I put myself in your hands
and the king's."</p>

<p>Lancelot stood looking grimly down upon him,
at a loss what to do. To slay him was the wish
of his heart; yet it looked like murder to kill a
praying wretch. In his doubt he turned towards
the queen, and she nodded her head as if to bid
him kill the villain.</p>

<p>"Rise, sir hound," cried Lancelot. "You shall
fight this battle to the utterance."</p>

<p>"I will never rise," said Meliagrance, "till you
grant me mercy as a yielding and recreant knight."</p>

<p>"Coward!" cried Lancelot. "If you fear to
fight me as I am, I will give you odds in the combat.
I will take off my armor from my head and
the left side of my body, and let them bind my
left hand behind me, and fight you with my right
hand alone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>At this perilous offer Meliagrance started hastily
to his feet, and loudly cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord Arthur, you have heard this offer!
I accept it. Let him be disarmed and bound as
he says."</p>

<p>"You do not mean to keep this foolish promise,
Lancelot?" demanded the king.</p>

<p>"That do I," said Lancelot. "I shall not go
back on my word, be it wise or foolish."</p>

<p>"Then so let it be; but you invite death by such
a reckless compact."</p>

<p>The attendant knights thereupon removed Lancelot's
helmet, and took from him his shield and
the armor from his left side. They then bound
his left arm behind him, and thus arrayed he was
placed before his antagonist, whose heart burned
with hope and with murderous designs.</p>

<p>All those who looked on were full of fear for
Lancelot, deeming it the height of folly that he
should take such a frightful risk, while many
ladies closed their eyes, in dread to see him slain.</p>

<p>With the inspiration of hope, Meliagrance came
up, bearing his sword uplifted, while Lancelot stood
with his head and side fully open to his stroke.
Down came the blade with a deadly sweep that
caused many men to close their eyes, sure that the
knights head would be cleft in twain.</p>

<p>But Lancelot had no such thought. With a
light swing to the right he avoided the stroke,
which cut idly through the air; then, stepping
forward to give effect to the blow, he swung his
own blade upward with giant strength, and brought
it down on Meliagrance's helmet with such mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
force that the hard steel and the head it covered
were shorn in twain, and the traitor knight fell
dead upon the field.</p>

<p>Wild were the shouts of joy and triumph at this
unlooked-for end to the combat. The king sprang
from his seat and rushed into the lists, where he
warmly clasped Lancelot in his arms; while
Guenever, in joy at her deliverance, kissed him
on both cheeks; and all the knights crowded around
them with glad cries and warm congratulations.</p>

<p>As for Meliagrance, he was given the burial of
a recreant and traitor, the cause of his death being
inscribed on his tomb, that all might read his dishonor.</p>

<p>But for Sir Lancelot, the king and queen made
more of him, and felt more love for him in their
hearts, than ever before.</p>

<p>After this time many events of interest took
place of which we have little space to speak.
Among them, Lancelot healed the wounds of a
knight of Hungary, named Sir Urre, who had been
held in pain, through sorcery, for seven years, till his
wounds should be touched by the best knight in
the world. This knight had a lovely sister, named
Felelolie, whom Lavaine married, whereupon King
Arthur made him a Knight of the Round Table,
and gave him a barony of land.</p>

<p>As for Lancelot, he gained great fame as the
Chevalier of the Cart. For as many lords and
ladies made sport of him as the knight who had ridden
in a cart, like one sentenced to the gallows, for
a whole twelvemonth he never mounted horse, but
rode only in a cart, during which time he had many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
adventures and fought forty battles, in all of which
he came off victor.</p>

<p>And so the days grew into years, and all went
happily at Arthur's court, though each passing
day brought the coming time of woe and disaster
nearer to hand.</p>

<h3>THE HAND OF DESTINY.</h3>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h4>THE TRAPPING OF THE LION.</h4>


<p>In May, when every lusty heart flourisheth and
bourgeoneth,&mdash;for as winter, with its rough winds
and blasts, causes man and woman to cover and
sit fast by the fire, this fresh and joyous season
brings them forth to gladden in the coming of the
flowery summer,&mdash;in this rare month of May, when
only merry thoughts and gentle deeds should be
known, there began a great and unhappy season
of wrath, which ended not till the flower of chivalry
of all the world was destroyed. And this all came
about through the hate and jealousy of two unhappy
knights, Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred,
brothers unto Sir Gawaine.</p>

<p>For much in their secret souls they hated the
queen and Lancelot, and they fell to watching this
good knight daily and nightly, with the hope of
bringing him in some way to shame.</p>

<p>Failing in this base endeavor, they no longer
concealed their enmity, but began to talk openly
of the love of Lancelot for the queen, and to hint
that shameful relations existed between them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
report of this slanderous talk coming to Gawaine's
ears, he reproved them sharply for indulging in
such base and unworthy scandal, in which he was
joined by his brothers Gareth and Gaheris.</p>

<p>"You forget what Lancelot has done for you,"
said Gawaine. "Who but he rescued you both
when held in prison by Sir Turquine? And many
other things he has done in your favor. Methinks
such kind deeds merit better return than this."</p>

<p>"Think as you will," said Agravaine, "I have
my opinions and shall hide them no longer."</p>

<p>As they thus debated King Arthur approached.</p>

<p>"Now, brothers, stint your noise," said Gawaine.</p>

<p>"That will we not," they replied.</p>

<p>"Then the devil speed the pair of you, if you
are bent on mischief! I will listen to no more of
your slanderous talk."</p>

<p>"Nor will we," said Gareth and Gaheris. "We
owe too much to Lancelot to listen to the false
tales of evil tongues."</p>

<p>With this they turned and walked away in anger
and grief, as Arthur came up.</p>

<p>"What is this?" asked the king. "Is there bad
blood between you brethren?"</p>

<p>"They do not care to hear the truth," said
Agravaine, "but to my fancy it has been kept too
long from your knowledge. We are your sister's
sons, King Arthur, and it is our duty to be honest
and open with you."</p>

<p>"What would you say?" asked the king.</p>

<p>"Simply what we and all your court know well,
that there are such doings between Lancelot and
your queen as are a disgrace to this realm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
England. He is a traitor to your person and your
honor, and this we stand ready to prove."</p>

<p>"This is a perilous charge you make," said
Arthur, deeply moved. "Nor am I ready to believe
such a tale on your mere word. You have gone
far, gentlemen; too far, I deem, without abundant
proof."</p>

<p>"My lord," said Mordred, "we speak not without
due warrant, and proof you shall have. What
we advise is, that you ride out to the hunt to-morrow.
Lancelot, you will find, will have some
excuse to hold back. Then, when night draws near,
send word to the queen that you will lie out all
that night. Let this be done, and we promise you
we shall take him with the queen. If we do it will
go hard with Lancelot; for we shall not lightly see
our king brought to shame."</p>

<p>"Be it so," said the king, after deep thought,
for he was little inclined to believe ill of Lancelot.
"I will do as you say. Understand, sir knights, I
have heard all this before; yet I believe it not, and
I consent to your scheme only to put an end to the
vile voice of scandal."</p>

<p>On the next morning, as agreed upon, Arthur
rode to the hunt; but Lancelot excused himself,
as his enemies had predicted, on the plea that he
was in no mood for the chase. When night came
near a messenger from the king brought word to
Guenever that the hunting party had been drawn
far away, and would not return that night.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mordred and Agravaine selected
twelve knights, all of them enemies of Lancelot,
to whom they told their purpose, and set them on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
guard in the castle of Carlisle, where the court
then was. Of Lancelot's friends few were in the
court, for nearly all had gone with the king to the
hunt.</p>

<p>When night came, Lancelot told Bors, who dwelt
with him, that he had a fancy to go and speak with
the queen.</p>

<p>"Do not go to-night, I pray you," said Bors.</p>

<p>"Why not to-night?"</p>

<p>"I fear some plot of that rogue, Agravaine, who
has it in his heart to work you ill. I have heard
a whisper, and fear that the king's absence to-night
is part of a plot, and that an ambush is laid to do
you harm."</p>

<p>"Have no dread of that," said Lancelot. "I
wish only some minutes' conversation with the
queen, and will quickly return again."</p>

<p>"I should rather you would not go. I am in
doubt that some evil may come of it."</p>

<p>"Why say you this nephew? Do you deem that
I am a coward, or that the queen is my mistress,
as the evil-tongued say? I go because she has sent
for me, desiring to see me. Am I the man to deny
her request because there are foul-mouthed slanderers
abroad?"</p>

<p>"Go, then, since I see you will. God speed you,
and send you back safe and sound."</p>

<p>Lancelot thereupon wrapped himself in his mantle,
and taking his sword under his arm made his
way to the castle, which was some distance from his
residence. Here he sought and entered the queen's
chamber, where she awaited him with her ladies.</p>

<p>But no sooner had he done so, and scarcely had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
he spoken a word to his royal lady, than Mordred,
Agravaine, and their followers burst in tumult from
the chamber in which they had been concealed, and
loudly exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Traitor knight! Lancelot du Lake, false and
caitiff wretch, now art thou taken in thy treason!"</p>

<p>So loud they cried that their voices rang throughout
the court, and they crowded round the door
of the queen's chamber, bent on taking Lancelot unarmed,
and slaying him at the feet of Guenever.
Fortunately the door was of solid oak, and a damsel
of the queen had hastily shot the bolts.</p>

<p>"Alas!" cried the queen, "what vile plot is
this? Mischief is around us, Lancelot!"</p>

<p>"Is there any armor in your chamber?" asked
Lancelot. "If so, give it to me, and I will face
this malicious crew."</p>

<p>"There is none," said the queen. "I see no
hope, and fear our love has come to a fatal end.
There seems to be a host of armed knights without.
They will kill you, Lancelot, and death will
come to me through their vile charge of unchastity."</p>

<p>"Why did I not even wear as much of my armor
as I fought Meliagrance with!" cried Lancelot, in
distress. "If I had but listened to Sir Bors! Never
was I caught in such a trap before."</p>

<p>As they spoke the tumult without increased, and
Mordred and Agravaine cried together,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come out, thou traitor knight! Think not to
escape, for we have you like a rat in a trap. Come
out and meet your just deserts."</p>

<p>"Shall I bear this?" cried Lancelot, flaming
into anger. "The dogs! a dozen of them in armor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
against one man in his mantle! I would rather
meet death at once than stand and hear their reviling
tongues."</p>

<p>Then he took the queen in his arms and kissed
her, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Most noble Christian queen, I beseech you, as
you have ever been my special good lady, and I
your poor knight, and as I never failed you in
right or wrong since the day that King Arthur
made me knight, that you will pray for my soul if
I be here slain. For you may be sure that Sir
Bors and my other kindred, with Lavaine and others
of my friends, will rescue you from harm, and I
beg you to go with them and live like a queen on
my lands."</p>

<p>"That will I not, Lancelot," said the queen. "If
you are slain for me, then death may come when
it will, for I shall not live long to mourn you."</p>

<p>"Then, since my last hour seems to have come,
and our love and life must cease together, so let
it be; but some of those barking curs shall go with
me to the shades. I am heavier at heart for you
than for myself. Ah, that I had but a knight's
armor!"</p>

<p>"I would that God would be content with my
death, and suffer you to escape," said the queen.</p>

<p>"That shall never be," said Lancelot. "God
defend me from such a shame. And now may the
Lord Jesus be my shield and my armor."</p>

<p>This said, he wrapped his mantle around his
arm, and approached the door. As he did so the
strong oaken portal trembled under their blows,
for they had got a great form out of the hall, and
were using it as a battering-ram.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>"Save your trouble, you crew of mischief," said
Lancelot. "Think you that Lancelot du Lake
needs to be come at like a rabbit in its hutch? I
fear you not, and dread not to face an army of such
hounds."</p>

<p>"Come out, then, or let us into that chamber.
It avails you nothing to strive against us all; but
we will promise to spare your life till we have
brought you to King Arthur."</p>

<p>"Will you?" said Lancelot, "or do you think to
slay me where I stand? I trust you not, liars."</p>

<p>Then he unbarred the door and with his left
hand held it open a little, so that but one man could
enter at a time. As he did so, Colgrevance of
Gore, who stood nearest, pressed forcibly through
the opening, and struck a spiteful blow at Lancelot
with his sword. This Lancelot parried, and returned
so fierce a stroke with his own good blade, that he
cut through the helmet and skull of the knight,
and stretched him dead upon the floor.</p>

<p>Then, with all his great strength, he dragged the
bleeding corpse within the chamber, closed the door
against the pressure of all who bore upon it, and
replaced the bars. "So much for this daring fool,"
he cried. "Thank heaven, I have an armor now!
I shall not be quite a sheep at the shambles."</p>

<p>As he spoke he was hastily stripping the armor
from the body of the dead knight. This done, he
quickly arrayed himself in it, with the aid of the
queen and her ladies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the assault on the door continued,
and Mordred and Agravaine kept up their cry,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Traitor knight! come out of the queen's chamber!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>"Hold your peace," cried Lancelot. "You shall
not prison me here, I promise you that, and if
you take my counsel, you will depart. I am ready
to agree on my knighthood to appear to-morrow
before the king, and answer there that I came not
to the queen with any evil purpose; and this I
stand ready to prove by word or deed."</p>

<p>"Out on you, traitor!" cried Mordred. "Have
you, we will, and slay you if we wish, for the king
has given us the choice to save you or slay you."</p>

<p>"Is that your last word, sirrahs? Then keep
yourselves, for I am not of the breed that die
easily."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he flung down the bars and threw
the door wide open. Then he strode proudly and
mightily among them, sword in hand and clad in
full armor, and at the first blow from his mighty
hand stretched Agravaine dead upon the floor.
Like a maddened lion that charges upon a herd
of sheep, he now rushed upon them, striking fiercely
to right and left, and felling men with every
blow, till in a little while twelve more of his assailants
lay cold in death, for there was not a man
of them all could stand one blow from his powerful
arm.</p>

<p>Of the whole party only Mordred remained alive,
and he fled wounded with craven haste. Then
Lancelot, leaning on his blood-dripping sword,
turned to the queen, who stood looking at his deeds
of might, with white lips and starting eyes.</p>

<p>"All is at an end now," he said. "Henceforth
King Arthur is my foe, and I am like a wolf at
bay. Yet I fear your enemies will work you fatal
harm, and would have you go with me, and let me
be your knight-protector."</p>

<p>"That I dread to do," said the queen, "for vile
slander would follow my footsteps. I had better
face my foes. If they devise to put me to death,
then you may come to my rescue, and no one then
can blame me for going with you."</p>

<p>"That shall I do," said Lancelot. "And I
promise to make such havoc among all men who
mean you harm as I have done among those who lie
here."</p>

<p>Then he kissed her, and each gave the other a
ring; and so he left the queen and went to his
lodgings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h4>THE RESCUE OF THE QUEEN.</h4>


<p>Little sleep came that night to Lancelot and
his friends. For when he came again to Bors, he
had found him, with others of his kindred, armed
and ready to come to his rescue. They listened
with concern and indignation to Lancelot's story
of how he had been entrapped, and heard with
knightly joy the story of his bold discomfiture of
his foes.</p>

<p>But it was evident to them all that the event
was one of the greatest moment; that enmity
would exist between Lancelot and the king, and
that Guenever might be adjudged to the stake on
the charge of infidelity to her lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>Therefore Bors took it upon himself to gather
in Lancelot's defence all his kindred and friends;
and by seven o'clock of the next morning he had
gained the word of twenty-two Knights of the
Round Table. To these were added knights of
North Wales and Cornwall, who joined Lancelot
for Lamorak's and Tristram's sake, to the number
of fourscore.</p>

<p>To these Lancelot told all that had occurred,
and expressed his fear of Arthur's hostility.</p>

<p>"I am sure of mortal war," he said, "for these
knights claimed to have been sent and ordained by
King Arthur to betray me, and I fear the king
may, in his heat and malice, condemn the queen
to the fire. Trust me, that I will not suffer her
to be burnt for my sake. She is and has been ever
a true lady to her lord, and while I live she shall
not become a victim to the malice of her enemies."</p>

<p>The assembled knights agreed with him in this
decision, and promised their utmost aid in his purpose
of rescue.</p>

<p>"Rescue her I shall, whoever may be hurt; and
I trust to heaven that no friend of mine will aid
the king to her injury. But if I rescue her, where
shall I keep her?"</p>

<p>"Did not the noble Sir Tristram, with your good
will, keep La Belle Isolde three years in Joyous
Gard, against the malice of King Mark?" said
Bors. "That place is your own; and there, if the
king adjudge the queen to the stake, you may keep
her till his heat shall cool. Then you may bring
her home with worship, and gain Arthur's thanks."</p>

<p>"That may not work so well as you fancy," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
Lancelot. "You remember what a return Tristram
got from King Mark."</p>

<p>"That is another story," replied Bors. "You
know well that Arthur and Mark are men of different
mould. Mark could smile and play the traitor;
but no man living can say that King Arthur was
ever untrue to his word."</p>

<p>Their conference over, by the advice of Lancelot
the knights put themselves in ambush in a wood as
near Carlisle as they could secretly approach. And
there they remained on guard, waiting to learn what
the king might do.</p>

<p>Meantime Mordred, though wounded by Lancelot's
sword, had managed to mount his horse, and
rode in all haste to tell the king of the bloody end
of the ambush. On hearing the story, Arthur's mind
was divided between anger and pain.</p>

<p>"It grieves me sorely that Lancelot should be
against me," he said; "and much I fear that the
glorious fellowship of the Round Table is broken,
for many of our noblest knights will hold with
him. But dishonor must not rest upon England's
crown. The queen has played me false, and shall
suffer death for her treason to her wifely duty."</p>

<p>For the law was such in those days, that all, of
whatever estate or degree, found guilty of treason,
should suffer death. And so it was ordained in
Queen Guenever's case&mdash;since thirteen knights had
been slain, and one escaped sore wounded, in defending
the king's honor&mdash;that she should be taken
to the stake, and there be burnt to death as a
traitress.</p>

<p>"My lord Arthur," said Gawaine, "let me counsel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
you not to be over hasty in this severe judgment,
for as I take it the guilt of the queen is not proved.
That Lancelot was found in the queen's chamber I
admit; but he might have come there with no evil
purpose. You know how he has been for years her
chosen knight, and how much he has done for her.
She may have sent for him privily, to avoid scandal,
for conference on some innocent subject. What we
do for the best often turns to the worst, and I dare
affirm that my lady the queen is, and has always
been, faithful and true to her lord. As for Lancelot,
I doubt me not he will make good what I have
said with word and body, against any and all that
question or oppose."</p>

<p>"That I believe," said the king. "I know Lancelot's
way. But his boldness does not prove the
queen's innocence. For her he shall never fight
again, for she shall suffer the penalty of the law.
And if I can lay my hands on him, he shall die the
shameful death he richly merits."</p>

<p>"Then may Christ save me from ever seeing it,"
said Gawaine.</p>

<p>"Why say you this?" demanded the king, angrily.
"You have no cause to love him. Last
night he killed your brother Agravaine, and here
is Mordred sorely wounded. He also slew two of
your sons, Sir Florence and Sir Lovel."</p>

<p>"I know all that. But I gave them warning
beforehand of what would happen if they meddled
in this affair. They brought this fate on themselves.
As for Agravaine, he stirred up this scandalous
business, and has got his deserts."</p>

<p>"Say no more," cried the king, in hot indignation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
"I am resolved. The honor of Arthur's wife
must be above suspicion. She has fallen from chastity
and shall die the death. As for you, Gawaine,
I bid you arm in your best armor, with your brethren
Gareth and Gaheris, and bring her to the fire,
that she may there hear her judgment, and receive
the death she merits."</p>

<p>"No, my most noble lord, that shall I never
do," said Gawaine. "No man shall say that I had
aught to do with the death of this worthy lady,
or gave my word in favor of her death."</p>

<p>"Then bid your brothers, Gareth and Gaheris,
attend."</p>

<p>"They are young, and may not withstand your
will; but they shall not be there by my counsel,"
said Gawaine, stoutly.</p>

<p>"We must attend, if you command us," said
Gareth and Gaheris to the king. "But it will be
sorely against our wills. If come we must, it shall
be in peaceful guise, and without warlike array."</p>

<p>"Come as you will," said the king. "This I
say, she shall have judgment this day."</p>

<p>"Alas! that I have ever lived to see this woful
day!" said Gawaine, sadly, and as he turned away
the tears ran hotly from his eyes.</p>

<p>But the king was bitterly set in his deadly purpose,
and no sooner had he reached Carlisle than
he gave command that the queen should at once
be led to the place of execution, there to be burned
as a traitress.</p>

<p>When this fatal decision was known in the castle
there was weeping and wailing and wringing of
hands from many lords and ladies, while of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
knights there present, few would consent to wear
armor to compass the queen's death.</p>

<p>But Arthur's commands none dared question,
and the unhappy lady was shriven by her ghostly
father, and bound to the fatal stake. In a circle
around her stood a guard of armed knights, while
others were present without armor. But the king
was not there; nor would Gawaine show himself
at that shameful scene.</p>

<p>Then fire was set to the fagots that surrounded
the stake. But as the flames began to curl upwards
there came a shrill bugle-blast from a neighboring
wood, and of a sudden Lancelot and his knights
broke from their ambush, and rode upon those about
the fire, striking right and left at all who bore arms
and withstood them.</p>

<p>Down went the guard of knights before this
fierce onset, till full twenty of them lay dead on
the field. But by sad fortune, as Lancelot, in his
warlike fury pressed hither and thither, cutting
and slashing with the hot rage of the berserker,
he by mishap struck the two unarmed knights,
Gareth and Gaheris, and stretched them dead upon
the field.</p>

<p>This was in the thick of the fray, and he knew
not what he had done, for rather would he have
slain himself than harmed these, his faithful
friends. A few minutes sufficed to kill or disperse
all the guard. Then Lancelot sprang from his
horse, scattered the blazing fagots with his foot,
and with a blow of his sword severed the bonds
that fastened Guenever to the stake.</p>

<p>The unhappy lady fell, weeping, into his arms,
thanking him in broken accents. With all due haste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
he mounted her on a horse that had been provided,
and rode off with her and his following of gallant
knights to Joyous Gard, strong of heart and stout
of frame, and resolved to fight for her to the death,
for more than ever he felt himself her chosen knight.</p>

<p>And when word went through the country round
that Arthur and Lancelot were at odds, many a
good knight rode in all haste to his castle, bent
on taking his side in the coming war.</p>

<p>But when the news was brought to Arthur of
how Lancelot had rescued the queen, and slain
many of his knights, and in particular Gareth and
Gaheris, his anger turned to such bitter sorrow and
regret that he swooned from pure grief. And when
he came to his senses again he deeply moaned, and
reproached himself for the evil that had befallen.</p>

<p>"Alas! that I ever wore the crown!" he bewailed.
"Within these two days I have lost forty
knights, and, above all, the noble fellowship of
Lancelot and his kindred, and all because I listened
to the tongue of foul detraction. Alas! that ever
this fatal thing began! Fair friends, see that none
of you tell Gawaine of what has happened, for he
loves Gareth so deeply that I fear, when he hears
of his death, he will go out of his mind. How came
Lancelot to slay these knights, who both loved him
devotedly?"</p>

<p>"He would never have harmed them had he
known them," said a knight. "It was in the midst
of the hurtling and fierce struggling, when swords
strike they know not where. Sad he will be when
he learns what he has done."</p>

<p>"I am heavier for the loss of my knights than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
of my queen," said Arthur, sadly. "Other queens
may be had, but such a fellowship of knights can
never be brought together again. And this I know,
that when Gawaine learns of Gareth's death, he will
never rest, nor suffer me to rest, till I have destroyed
Lancelot and his kindred, or they have destroyed
me. Ah, Agravaine, Agravaine, Jesus forgive thy
soul for thy evil will, for thou and thy brother
Mordred have caused all this bitter sorrow."</p>

<p>While the king thus complained, a tale-bearer,
unheeding his injunctions, came to Gawaine big
with his story, and told him of the rescue of the
queen, and the death of a knightly host.</p>

<p>"What else could Lancelot do?" said Gawaine.
"I should have done as much myself had I stood
in his place. But where are my brothers? Why
hear I not of them?"</p>

<p>"Truly," said the man; "they are both killed."</p>

<p>"Now, Jesus forbid! What! both? Is Gareth
slain? Dare you tell me so?"</p>

<p>"Alas! the pity of it!"</p>

<p>"Killed! Who killed him?"</p>

<p>"Sir Lancelot slew them both."</p>

<p>"That is false. Gareth loved him better than
he did me or the king. He would have joined
him against us all, had Lancelot desired. And he
was unarmed. Dare you repeat this story?" and
he caught the man fiercely by the shoulders and
glared wildly in his face.</p>

<p>"Sir, it is so noised abroad," said the man.</p>

<p>"Then is all joy gone from my life," moaned
Gawaine, and he fell to the floor in a deep swoon,
in which he lay long like one dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>But when Gawaine recovered, and had sought
the king, and learned that his two brothers had
been killed, unarmed and defenceless, his sorrow
changed to bitter and revengeful anger.</p>

<p>"My king, my lord, and my uncle," he sternly
said, "I vow by my knighthood that I shall never
forgive Lancelot for this murderous deed, but from
this day forth shall remain his deadly foe, till one
of us has slain the other. War to the death it shall
be, and if you aid me not I shall seek Sir Lancelot
alone, if it be through seven kings' realms, till I
hold him to answer for this deed of blood."</p>

<p>"You shall not need to seek him so far," said
the king. "They say that Lancelot awaits us in
Joyous Gard, and that many knights have joined
him."</p>

<p>"Well is it so," said Gawaine fiercely. "Then
my lord Arthur, gather your friends, and I will
gather mine. Say not that deeds like this shall go
unpunished in England's realm. Your justice defied!
My unarmed brothers murdered! Shall this
be done, and we basely submit?"</p>

<p>"You speak to the point," said the king. "We
must strike for honor and revenge. Strong as Lancelot's
castle is, and bold as are his friends, I fancy
I can gain strength enough to draw him out of the
strongest tower in it."</p>

<p>Then King Arthur sent orders far and wide
through the land, and in brief time there came to
Carlisle many knights, dukes, and earls, so that
he had a great host. These the king informed of
what had happened, and of his purpose to force
Lancelot to yield up his queen, and to punish him
for his trespass.</p>

<p>Lancelot meanwhile, was not idle, but drew to
himself, many more knights, and provisioned his
castle fully, for he well knew that he must abide
behind walls, as he was far too weak to meet the
king's host in the field.</p>

<p>Not many days had elapsed when King Arthur
and Gawaine with a great host of men, laid siege
about Joyous Gard, both the town and the castle,
and war replaced the peace that had reigned so
long in the land.</p>

<p>But Lancelot lay secure in his castle, and for
a long time would not go out himself, nor suffer
any of his knights to pass the gates of town or
castle. And so fifteen weeks of the siege passed
away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h4>THE RETURN OF GUENEVER.</h4>


<p>It befell upon a day in harvest-time that Lancelot
looked over the walls of Joyous Gard, and
seeing below him the king and Gawaine, thus spoke
to them,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lords both, you besiege this castle in vain.
You will gain more dishonor than worship here.
If I chose to come out, with my knights, I should
soon bring this war to an end."</p>

<p>"Come forth, if thou darest!" cried the king,
in anger. "I promise to meet thee in the midst
of the field."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>"God defend that I should face on the field of
battle the noble king who made me knight."</p>

<p>"A truce to your fair language," answered the
king. "Trust me, that I am your mortal foe, and
will be so till the day of my death. You have
slain my knights and dishonored my queen, and
hold her from me by force, like a traitor. Think
you I shall lightly forgive this?"</p>

<p>"You may say what you will, my lord and
king," answered Lancelot. "With you I will not
fight; but as for your lady Guenever, I am ready
to stand for her innocence against any knight
under heaven. Those who have slandered me and
her lie in their teeth, and I hold myself ready to
prove to the death that she is as true and chaste
a lady as ever lived. More than once, my lord, you
have consented that she should be burnt, from the
voice of slander, and more than once have I rescued
her, and forced the lie down the throats of her slanderers.
Then you thanked me for saving her from
the fire. Now, for doing you the same high service
again, you bring war upon me. Your queen is honest
and true, and if you will receive her to your good
grace again I stand ready to deliver her."</p>

<p>"Recreant knight!" cried Gawaine, in wrath,
"I warrant you my lord the king shall have his
queen and you too, despite your fair words and
proud defiance, and shall slay you both if it please
him."</p>

<p>"That may be, Gawaine," said Lancelot. "Yet
if I chose to come out of the castle you would not
find it quite child's play to win me and the queen."</p>

<p>"Save your boastful words," said Gawaine. "As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
for my lady, the queen, I shall say naught to her
dishonor. But, recreant knight, what cause had you
to slay my brother Gareth, who loved you with his
whole soul?"</p>

<p>"I shall not seek an excuse for that deed," said
Lancelot. "I would with as good will have slain
my nephew Sir Bors. All I may say is that it was
done in the heat of battle, and I knew not they
were slain till word was brought me here."</p>

<p>"You lie in your teeth!" cried Gawaine. "You
killed them in despite of me; and for this foul deed
I shall make war on you while I live."</p>

<p>"If you are so hotly set, there is no use for me
to seek accord; yet I am truly sorry for their
deaths and your enmity. Only for this I would soon
have the good grace of my lord Arthur."</p>

<p>"That may be, traitor, but you will wait long
for peace. You have lorded it over me, and the
whole of us, too long, and slain knights at your
will. Now our turn has come."</p>

<p>"No one dare say that I ever killed a knight
through treachery, as you, Gawaine, have done."</p>

<p>"You mean Sir Lamorak. Him I slew, man to
man."</p>

<p>"Who lies now? You know well that you and
the crew that set upon him dared not meet him
face to face. You struck him treacherously from
behind."</p>

<p>"A truce to Lamorak. This you may know,
that I will never leave you till I deal with you as
I did with him."</p>

<p>"Murder me, you mean! I fancy you might
if you caught me in such a strait, which you will
not easily do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>Then others took the cue from Gawaine, and
the cry went up from many voices: "False and
recreant knight! how long will you hide behind
your castle walls, like a rat in his hole?"</p>

<p>"How long is this to last?" said Bors and others
to Lancelot. "We pray you to keep us no longer
within these walls, but let us out to do battle with
them. Men will say next that you are afraid. As
for fair speech, it is thrown away. Gawaine will
never forgive you, nor suffer you to make accord
with the king. Therefore fight for your right, for
to that it must come."</p>

<p>"I am loath to do so," said Lancelot.</p>

<p>Then he called from the wall to the king,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My knights demand that I let them sally from
the castle. I therefore pray that neither you nor
Sir Gawaine come into the field, for to you two I
wish no harm."</p>

<p>"What then? Shall we cower in our tents while
others fight our battles?" cried Gawaine. "This
quarrel is mine and the king's. Shall we not fight
in it?"</p>

<p>"If you will, you will; but I seek not battle with
either of you."</p>

<p>Then they drew back, and both sides made ready
for battle. And Gawaine, with deadly intent, set
aside a strong body of knights, bidding them to
attack Lancelot in force, and slay him if they could.</p>

<p>When the next morning came, King Arthur drew
up his host against the castle in three great bands.
And Lancelot's fellowship issued from the castle
at three gates, the three bands being led by Lancelot,
Bors, and Lionel. But Lancelot had given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
strict charge to his knights to avoid harming King
Arthur and Sir Gawaine.</p>

<p>Fierce was the battle that followed, and many
good knights were slain. It began with a challenge
from Gawaine, who came out before the king's
host and dared any knight of Lancelot's to joust
with him. This challenge Lionel accepted, but
Gawaine thrust him through the body, and dashed
him to the earth like a dead man. Then his
friends rushed to his rescue and drove back his foes,
bearing him from the field into the castle. This
affray brought on a hot and fiery battle, and soon
the air was filled with shouts, and the earth strewn
with dead and wounded men.</p>

<p>In the midst of this fray the king hotly attacked
Lancelot; but that faithful knight patiently endured
his assault, and lifted not a hand in defence.
But Bors, seeing his danger, rushed in, and, with
a spear thrust, hurled King Arthur to the ground.
Quickly leaping from his horse, he drew his sword,
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shall I make an end of this war?"</p>

<p>"On pain of your head, no! Harm not the
king! I shall not stand by and see him slain."</p>

<p>Then Lancelot sprang to the ground and helped
the king to his horse again, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord Arthur, for God's sake, end this strife!
I will not fight you, though you kill me, nor have
I the heart to fight your men. My lord, remember
what I have done for you. Is not this an evil
reward?"</p>

<p>When Arthur heard these words tears flowed
from his eyes, for Lancelot's courtesy had overcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
his anger. He turned and rode away, saying
sadly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alas! that this war ever began."</p>

<p>Then both sides drew off, and parties of each
began the sad duty of burying the dead, while the
wounded were borne away, and healing salves applied
to their wounds.</p>

<p>The next day the battle was renewed, and fought
with the same deadly energy as before. On this
day Bors led the foremost party, and met Gawaine
as Lionel had done the day before. Fiercely together
they rode, and both were hurled to the ground
with deep and dangerous wounds. Around them
the battle raged with double fierceness, but Lancelot
broke in and rescued Bors, and had him borne
to the castle, while the other party bore off
Gawaine.</p>

<p>Then, as the battle continued, Lavaine and others
begged Lancelot to put forth his strength and fight
with his full might, for he imperilled them all by
his forbearance.</p>

<p>"Why should you spare your foes?" they said.
"You do but harm thereby. Your enemies spare
not you."</p>

<p>"I have no heart to fight against the king," said
Lancelot.</p>

<p>"If you spare them all this day they will never
thank you," said Palamides. "And if they get
the better of you they will slay you without mercy."</p>

<p>Lancelot saw that this was but the truth, and
stirred by this and the wound of Sir Bors, he
rushed into the fray with his old might and fury,
forcing back all before him. Glad to see the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Lancelot, his followers pressed forward, driving
back the foe, so that by eventide they had the best
of the fray, and their horses went fetlock deep in
the blood of the slain.</p>

<p>Then, in pity for Arthur, Lancelot blew the
recall, and suffered the king's party to withdraw
without further slaughter.</p>

<p>After this there was peace between the parties
for many days, for Gawaine had been so sorely
hurt that he could not stir the king to active war,
and Arthur after awhile returned to Carlisle, leaving
the castle closely besieged.</p>

<p>But the story of this war had now passed
through Christendom, and had reached the pope,
who, feeling that war between King Arthur and
Lancelot was like battle between brothers, sent a
letter to the king, commanding him, under pain
of an interdict upon all England, to take his
Queen Guenever into favor again, and to make peace
and accord with Sir Lancelot.</p>

<p>This Papal bull was brought to Arthur by the
bishop of Rochester, who was then at Rome. When
the king had heard it read he knew not what to
do. He agreed to take back the queen, and in his
heart desired to make friends with Lancelot; but
to this Gawaine, who had then the greatest influence
over him, would not consent.</p>

<p>In the end it was agreed that if Lancelot would
bring back the queen he should come and go in
safety, and that no word should be spoken to
Guenever, by the king or other person, of aught
that had happened in the past.</p>

<p>Then the bishop had from the king his assurance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
under the great seal of the realm, as he was
a true anointed knight, that Sir Lancelot should
come and return in safety, and that the queen
should not be spoken to by the king, or any other,
concerning what had passed. With this safe-conduct,
written at length and signed by King Arthur,
the holy prelate rode in state to Joyous Gard, where
he made Lancelot acquainted with all that had happened,
telling him of the pope's action, and of the
peril he would encounter if he withheld the queen
from the king.</p>

<p>"It was never in my thought," said Lancelot,
"to withhold Queen Guenever from my lord Arthur.
All men know why I have her in charge.
She would have suffered a shameful death through
the king's unjust anger had I not been on hand to
save her life; and I hold her only from peril of
that vile sentence, which has never until now been
remitted. I thank the pope heartily that he has
made peace between Guenever and the king, and
God knows that I will be a thousand-fold gladder
to take her back than I ever was to bring her away.
All I demand is, that I shall come and go in safety,
and that the queen shall have her liberty as before,
and stand in no peril from this or any former
charge against her. For else I dare venture to
keep her from a harder shower than ever yet has
fallen upon her or me."</p>

<p>"You need dread nothing either for yourself or
the queen," replied the bishop. "You know full
well that the pope must be obeyed, by the king as
well as by you. It were not to the pope's worship
nor my poor honor that you should be distressed, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
the queen put to shame or peril. And as for King
Arthur, here is his promise, under his own writing
and seal."</p>

<p>Then he showed Lancelot all the written documents
he had brought, both from the pope and the
king.</p>

<p>"That suffices," said Lancelot. "I would trust
King Arthur's bare word as I would the oath of
half Christendom. No man can say that he ever
broke his plighted faith. Therefore, I beg you to
ride before me to the king, and recommend me to
his good grace, letting him know that in eight days
from to-day, by the grace of God, I shall bring to
him his lady Queen Guenever. And say this further
to him, that I stand ready to meet any one in
the lists for the queen's fair fame except himself
and Sir Gawaine, and the latter more from the
king's love for him than from aught of his own
deserts."</p>

<p>With this agreement the bishop departed to
Carlisle, and when he had told the king how nobly
Lancelot had spoken, the tears started from Arthur's
eyes, and much he deplored in his heart the
cruel chance that had aroused war between him and
his dearest friend.</p>

<p>Lancelot now made ready a hundred knights,
who were all dressed in green velvet, with their
horses trapped to their heels, while each knight
held in his hand an olive branch, in token of peace.
For the queen there were provided four and twenty
gentlewomen, who followed her in the same guise;
while Lancelot was followed by twelve coursers, on
each of which sat a young gentleman, and these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
were arrayed in green velvet with golden girdles,
and the horses trapped to the heels with rich cloths,
set with pearls and stones in gold, to the number
of a thousand. As for Lancelot and Guenever, they
were clothed in white cloth-of-gold tissue. And
in this array they rode from Joyous Gard to Carlisle,
and through Carlisle to the castle, while many
an eye shed tears on seeing them.</p>

<p>Then Lancelot alighted and took the queen, and
led her to where Arthur sat, with Gawaine and
many great lords before him. Then he kneeled,
and the queen with him.</p>

<p>Many of the assembled knights wept bitterly
on seeing this, but the king sat in haughty silence,
looking steadily upon the pair who knelt before him.
Seeing his countenance, Lancelot rose and forced
the queen to rise also. Then thus he spoke in
knightly pride,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord the king, by the pope's command and
yours I have brought you my lady, the queen, as
right requireth. If there be any knight, whatever
his degree, except your sacred self, who shall dare
say she has been untrue to you, I, Lancelot du
Lake, stand ready to make her honor good with my
body. To liars you have listened, and that has
caused all the trouble between you and me. Time
has been, my lord Arthur, when you have been
greatly pleased with me in that I did battle for
my lady your queen. Full well you know, my most
royal sir, that she has been put to great wrong
before this time; and since it pleased you then
that I should fight for her, it seems to me that I
had still more cause this last time to rescue her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
from the fire, since she was to have been burnt for
my sake. Had not the might of God been with me,
think you that I could, unarmed, have prevailed
over fourteen armed knights? I was sent for by the
queen, who wished to confer with me, but had barely
stepped within her chamber, when out burst Mordred
and Agravaine, calling me traitor and recreant
knight."</p>

<p>"They called you truly," said Gawaine.</p>

<p>"Did they so, Gawaine? By heaven, in their
quarrel they failed to prove themselves in the
right."</p>

<p>"I have given you no cause to do evil to me,
Lancelot," said the king. "For I have loved you
and yours more than all my other knights."</p>

<p>"My good lord and liege," answered Lancelot,
"I beg it may not displease you if I answer that
you have better cause to love me and mine than
most knights, for none have done you such service
as we have at many times and in many places.
Often have I myself rescued you from deadly peril,
when you were hard pressed by your foes; and it
has ever been my joy to please you, and my lord
Gawaine as well, in jousts and tournaments, and in
set battles, both on horse and on foot. I wish not
to boast of my deeds, yet you all know well that
I never met a knight but that I was able to stand
against him, and have always done my duty like
a man. I have been matched with good knights,
such as Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak, whom I
loved for their valor and honesty. And I take God
to witness, that I was never angry with or jealous
of any good knight whom I saw active to win honor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
and was ever glad at heart when I found a knight
who was able to endure me on horseback or on foot.
Sir Carados of the dolorous tower was a noble
knight and a man of mighty strength, and this
you know full well, Sir Gawaine, since he pulled
you from your horse, and bound you before him on
his saddle. Yet I rescued you from him, and slew
him before your eyes. In like manner I found his
brother, Sir Turquine, leading your brother, Sir
Gaheris, bound on his saddle, and slew him, and
rescued your brother, as also three-score and four
of King Arthur's knights whom he held in prison.
Never met I with as strong and hard-fighting knights
as Sir Carados and Sir Turquine, and I fought
with them to the uttermost for the sake of you and
your brother. It seems to me, Sir Gawaine, that
you ought to bear in mind this good service I did
for you in the past. If I might but have your
good will in return, I would trust to God to have
my lord Arthur's kindly grace."</p>

<p>"The king may do as he will," said Gawaine;
"but while I live I shall never be in accord with
you. I cannot forget that you have killed three
of my brothers, two of them treacherously and
pitilessly, for they wore no armor against you, and
refused to bear any."</p>

<p>"Would to heaven they had been armed, for then
they would now be alive," said Lancelot. "I tell
you this, Sir Gawaine, that I love none of my own
kinsmen as I did your brother, Sir Gareth, and
would far rather have slain myself than him. Never
while I live shall I cease to mourn his death, not
alone for your bitter sorrow and anger, but for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
other causes which concern myself. One is, that
it was I who made him a knight; another is, that
he loved me above all other knights; a third is,
that he was ever noble, true, courteous, and gentle.
I never would have slain, or even hurt, either
Gareth or Gaheris by my will; and sad at heart am
I that this fatal chance has robbed me of your
love and made undying war between us, and has
caused my noble lord and king to be my mortal foe.
May Jesus forgive me for this cruel chance, which
the fates have laid upon me. In reparation for this
sad misfortune, I shall freely offer, if it will
please the king's good grace, and yours, my lord
Gawaine, to do penance in this wise. I shall start
from Sandwich, and go in my shirt, barefoot, and
at every ten miles' end I shall found a religious
house, of what order you wish, where shall be sung
and read day and night psalms and masses for the
repose of Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris. This I
shall perform from Sandwich to Carlisle. This, Sir
Gawaine, seems to me fairer, holier, and better for
their souls than that you and the king should make
war upon me; for little good to any is likely to
come from it."</p>

<p>Then the knights and ladies there wept as though
they were distracted, and the tears fell hot on King
Arthur's cheeks. But no shadow of softness came
to Gawaine's stern face.</p>

<p>"The king, as I have said, may do as it pleases
him," he answered, "but I shall never forgive you
for the murder of my brothers. If my uncle, King
Arthur, accords with you, he shall lose my service,
for I hold you false both to the king and me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>"The man lives not that can make that good,"
cried Lancelot. "If you charge me thus, I am ready
to answer you with spear and sword since words
you disdain."</p>

<p>"That cannot be at this time," said Gawaine.
"You are here under the king's safe-conduct, and
so must depart. If it were not for the pope's
command and the king's given word, I should do
battle with you, body to body, and prove upon
you that you have been false both to the king and
to me. In this land you shall not abide more than
fifteen days, for I give you open warning that your
safe-conduct lasts only for that time. In this the
king and we all were agreed before you came hither.
Only for this you would now find that my words
are ready to be backed up with deeds. And this
you shall find wheresoever I shall meet you hereafter."</p>

<p>Then Lancelot sighed, and tears fell upon his
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Alas, most Christian realm," he said, "that I
have loved above all other realms, and most Christian
king, whom I have worshipped next to my
God. From both I am banished, without cause or
warrant. Truly I am sorry that I ever came into
this land, to be thus causelessly and shamefully
treated, after my long service here. So is it ever
with fortune, whose wheel is so changeable that
there is no constant abiding; and this may be proved
by the old chronicles of noble Hector of Troy, and
Troilus, and Alexander the mighty conqueror, and
many more. When they were highest they quickly
became lowest; and thus has it fared with me. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
living men have brought more honor and glory to
the Round Table than I and my kindred, and yet
we stand banished from the land which owes us such
worthy service. As for you, Gawaine, I can live
upon my native lands as well as any knight here.
And if you, redoubted king, shall seek me there in
hostile array, I must endure you as well as I may.
If you come thither, Gawaine, see that you charge
me not with treason or felony, for if you do, it
will scarcely end with words."</p>

<p>"Do your worst," cried Gawaine, hotly. "And
get you gone from here as fast as you can. We
shall soon come after, and tumble your strongest
castle upon your head."</p>

<p>"That shall not need," said Lancelot. "You
may find me ready to meet you in open field."</p>

<p>"There have been words enough," said Gawaine.
"Deliver the queen and take yourself away."</p>

<p>"If I had looked for so short a reception I would
have thought twice before coming," answered Lancelot,
proudly. "If the queen had been as dear
to me as you would make her, I durst have kept
her from the best fellowship of knights under
heaven."</p>

<p>Then he turned to Guenever and said, in full
hearing of the king and all there,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Madam, now I must depart from you and this
noble fellowship forever. Since it is so, I beseech
you to pray for me. And if you be slandered by
any false tongues, send me word, my lady, and
if one knight's hands may deliver you by battle,
I shall deliver you."</p>

<p>Then Lancelot kissed the queen, and said openly
to all present,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>"Now let me see who there is in this place that
dare say Queen Guenever is not true unto my lord
King Arthur! Let him speak who dare speak."</p>

<p>He looked proudly around the hall, from right
to left, but no voice came in answer. Then he
took the queen by the hand and led her to the
king, and delivered her to his royal hand. This
done, Lancelot turned and walked from the hall
with haughty stride; and there was neither duke,
earl, nor king, baron nor knight, lady or maiden,
that wept not at the sorrowful parting, except Sir
Gawaine. And when Lancelot took his horse to
ride out of Carlisle there was sobbing and weeping
from all the people who had gathered in the streets
to see him depart. And so he took his way to Joyous
Gard, which ever after he called Dolorous Gard.
And thus departed Sir Lancelot du Lake from the
court of King Arthur forever.</p>

<p>He now called his fellowship about him, and
asked them what they would do.</p>

<p>"Whatever you will," they answered with one
voice.</p>

<p>"Then, my brave and faithful friends, we must
leave this realm. It is sore to me to be banished,
and had I not dreaded shame, the lady Guenever
should never have left me."</p>

<p>"If you stay in this land we shall not fail you,"
said his knights. "If you depart hence we shall
go with you."</p>

<p>"My fair lords, I thank you heartily," answered
Lancelot, with much feeling. "If you come with
me to my realm beyond the sea, I shall divide my
lands among you, till I have as little as any of you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
I care for only enough to live upon, and trust to
maintain you in knightly honor."</p>

<p>"So let it be," they rejoined. "Here, now that
the fellowship of the Round Table is broken, there
will be no more peace, but only strife and turmoil.
You were the stay of Arthur's court, Sir
Lancelot. With you gone, all quiet and harmony
will depart."</p>

<p>"You praise me too highly, gentlemen. I did
my duty; but not I alone. Yet I fear, when we
are gone, we will soon hear of wars and rebellions,
from those who dared not raise their heads when
we were all together. Mordred I fear above all.
He is envious and ambitious, and if King Arthur
shall trust him I dread me greatly he will find him
a stinging serpent."</p>

<p>Then, soon after, they left Joyous Gard, and
shipped at Cardiff to pass beyond the seas to Lancelot's
realm of Benwick. Some men, indeed, call
it Bayonne, and some call it Beume, the land
whence comes the wine of Beume. Yet to say sooth,
Lancelot and his nephews were lords of all France,
and had there a host of towns and castles, and
many people at their command.</p>

<p>There went with him a hundred proven knights,
whom he rewarded as he had promised. For he
shortly called a parliament, where he crowned Lionel
king of France. Bors he made king of the realm
of King Claudas; and Hector de Maris, King of
Benwick and Guienne; while his other knights were
made dukes and earls, till all were nobly provided
for.</p>

<p>Thus Lancelot rewarded his faithful friends.
And he furnished and provisioned his towns and
castles, and gathered the men of war of the realm,
for he felt well assured that Gawaine would not
rest till he had brought King Arthur against him
in martial array.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h4>THE WAR BETWEEN ARTHUR AND LANCELOT.</h4>


<p>What Lancelot had feared came quickly to pass.
For so unrelenting was Gawaine's enmity, and so
strong his influence over the king, that Arthur,
at his persistent instigation, got together a great
army, to the number of sixty thousand, and had
shipping made ready to carry them over the sea.</p>

<p>Then he made Sir Mordred chief ruler of all
England during his absence, and put Queen
Guenever under his care, little dreaming of what
fatal results would follow this unwise choice.</p>

<p>These preparations made, Arthur passed the sea
with his host, and landed in Lancelot's realm,
where, through the revengeful spirit of Gawaine,
they burnt and wasted all that they overran.</p>

<p>When word of this was brought to Lancelot and
his knights, Sir Bors thus broke out in anger,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord Sir Lancelot, it is a shame to let them
thus destroy this fair realm of France. You may
well be assured that, however long you forbear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
your foes, they will do you no favor if you fall
into their hands."</p>

<p>Then said Sir Lionel, who was wary and wise,
"My lord Sir Lancelot, this is my counsel. Let
us keep to our strong-walled towns till the invaders
suffer from hunger and cold, and blow upon their
nails for warmth. Then we may freshly set upon
them, and shred them down like sheep in a field."</p>

<p>"Such a course would disgrace us all," said King
Bagdemagus to Lancelot. "Your over-courtesy has
caused all the trouble we now have. If we let
Gawaine work his will, he will bring our power
to naught, while we hide like rabbits in our holes."</p>

<p>"So say I," broke in Sir Galihud. "There are
knights here who come of kings' blood, and that
will not long be content to droop behind walls. Give
us leave to meet them in the field, and we shall
deal with them in such fashion that they will curse
the time they came into this country."</p>

<p>Then spoke seven brethren of North Wales, men
of such prowess that one might seek through seven
lands before he could find seven such knights,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir Lancelot," they said together, "let us ride
out with Sir Galihud, for it has never been our
wont to cower in towns and castles."</p>

<p>"My fair lords," replied Lancelot to them all,
"I am loath to ride out with my knights and shed
Christian blood. And my lands, after all the wars
they have endured, are too bare long to sustain
this invading host. It is the part of wisdom, therefore,
for the time to keep to our walls, and meanwhile
I will send a messenger to King Arthur and
offer him a treaty of peace."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>Then he sent a damsel to the king, and a dwarf
with her, with a message, bidding Arthur to quit
making war upon his lands, and offering him fair
terms of accommodation. The damsel rode to
the hostile camp on a palfry, while the dwarf ran
by her side. When she came near to King Arthur's
pavilion she alighted, and there was met by a gentle
knight, Sir Lucan the butler, who said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fair damsel, come you from Sir Lancelot du
Lake?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," she replied, "I am come hither with
a message from him to my lord the king."</p>

<p>"Alas, that it should be needed!" said Sir Lucan.
"My lord Arthur would soon be in accord with
Lancelot but for Gawaine, who has more influence
over him than all his knights besides, and will not
suffer him to think of peace and friendship. I
pray to God, damsel, that you speed well in your
errand, for all that are about the king, except Sir
Gawaine, wish well to Lancelot above all knights
living."</p>

<p>With these words he led the damsel to the king's
pavilion. There Arthur, who had been advised
of her coming, sat with Gawaine to hear her message.
When she had told her errand the king was
so moved that tears ran from his eyes, and all
the lords were ready to advise him to make peace
with Lancelot. But Gawaine, who sat with lowering
brow, now broke out in hot speech,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord, my uncle, what will you do? Will
you turn again after having come so far? All
the world will speak villany of you."</p>

<p>"I do not deem it wise to refuse his fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
proffers," said the king. "Yet since I am come so
far on this journey, I leave it to you to give the
damsel her answer."</p>

<p>"Then tell Sir Lancelot," said Gawaine to the
damsel, "that he wastes his labor now to sue to
my uncle. If he wished peace he should have
sought it sooner. Now it is too late. Tell him,
also, that I, Sir Gawaine, promise him, by the faith
I owe to God and to knighthood, never to leave
him in peace till he have slain me or I him."</p>

<p>This word the damsel brought back to Lancelot,
where he stood among his knights, and sad of
heart he was to hear it.</p>

<p>"Why do you grieve?" said the knights. "If
war they want, let them have it to their fill. Let
us meet them in the field."</p>

<p>"Never before was I so loath to do battle," said
Lancelot. "I would rather flee from King Arthur
than fight him. Be ruled by me, noble sirs. When
I must defend myself, then I will; but haste will
make fresh sorrow."</p>

<p>Then the knights held their peace, and that
night took their rest. But in the morning, when
they looked abroad, they saw a hostile host around
the city of Benwick, pressing it so closely that ladders
were already set up against the walls. The
defenders of the town flocked in haste to the walls
and threw down the ladders, and hot strife began.</p>

<p>Forth now rode Sir Gawaine on a strong steed,
and with a great spear in his hand, and when he
came before the chief gate he called out loudly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir Lancelot, where art thou? Or what proud
knight is here that dare break a spear with me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>Hearing this challenge, Sir Bors hastily made
ready, and rode from the city to the encounter.
But Gawaine smote him from his horse, and would
have slain him had he not been rescued. Then
Lionel, his brother, rode out to revenge him; but
he, too, was sorely wounded, and so borne into the
town.</p>

<p>And thus, day after day, came Gawaine with
his challenge, and not a day passed but some
knight fell before his spear. And for half a year
the siege continued, and there was much slaughter
on both sides.</p>

<p>At length came a day when Gawaine again
appeared before the gates, armed at all points,
and loudly cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where art thou now, thou false traitor, Sir
Lancelot? Why hidest thou within walls and holes
like a coward? Come forth, traitor, that I may revenge
on thy body the death of my three brothers?"</p>

<p>Then said Lancelot's knights to their leader,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, Sir Lancelot, you must fight, or you are
shamed forever. It is time for you to stir, for you
have slept over long and we suffered over much."</p>

<p>"Defend myself I must, since he charges me
with treason," said Lancelot. "His words cut
deeply, and I must fight or be held recreant," and
with stern countenance he bade the attendants to
saddle his strongest horse and bring his arms to
the gate tower. Then from this tower he called
to the king, who stood below,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord Arthur," he said, "sad am I, for your
sake, that thus you press upon me. Had I been
revengeful I might have met you in open field, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
there made your boldest knights full tame; but
I have forborne you half a year, and given you
and Gawaine free way. It is much against my will
to fight with any of your blood, but since he accuses
me of treason I am driven to it like a beast
brought to bay."</p>

<p>"If you dare do battle," cried Gawaine, "leave
your babbling and come out. Nothing will give
deeper joy to my heart, for I have waited long
for this hour."</p>

<p>At this Lancelot mounted and rode out, and a
host of knights followed him from the city, while
from the king's army a throng of knights pressed
to the front. But covenant was made that none
should come near the two warriors till one was
dead or had yielded, and the knights drew back,
leaving a broad open space for the combatants.</p>

<p>Gawaine and Lancelot now rode far apart, and
wheeled their horses till they faced each other.
Thus they stood in grim silence and energy till the
signal for the onset was given, when, like iron
statues come to life, they plunged their spurs in
the flanks of their chargers and dashed at furious
speed across the plain. A minute passed, and they
met in the middle with a shock like thunder, but
the knights were so strong and their spears so
great, that the horses could not endure the buffets,
and fell to the earth.</p>

<p>In a moment both knights had leaped clear of
their saddles, drawn their swords, and brought
their shields before them. And now began a fierce
and terrible affray, for they stood and hewed at
each other with might and main, till blood burst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
in many places through the joints of their armor.</p>

<p>But Gawaine had a gift that a holy man had
given him, that every day in the year, from nine
o'clock till noon, his strength should increase till
it became threefold. And he took good care to fight
all his battles during these hours, whereby he gained
great honor.</p>

<p>None knew of this gift but King Arthur, and
as Lancelot felt the strength of his antagonist
constantly increasing, he wondered greatly, and
began to fear that he would be overcome. It
seemed to him that he had a fiend, and no earthly
man, before him, and for three hours he traced and
traversed, and covered himself with his shield,
scarcely able to stand against the brunt of Gawaine's
mighty blows. At this all men marvelled, for never
before had they beheld Lancelot so sorely driven
to defence.</p>

<p>But when the hour of noon had passed, the magic
might of Gawaine suddenly left him, and he had
now only his own strength. This Lancelot felt,
and he drew himself up and pressed on his foe,
saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have had your day, Gawaine; now it is
my turn. Defend yourself, for I have many a
grievous buffet to repay."</p>

<p>Then he redoubled his strokes, and at length
gave Gawaine such a blow on the helmet that he
fell to the earth. Lancelot now withdrew a step.</p>

<p>"Why do you withdraw?" cried Gawaine, bitterly.
"Turn, thou traitor, and slay me; for if I
recover you shall fight with me again."</p>

<p>"It is not my way, Sir Gawaine, to strike a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
fallen knight. When you want to fight again you
shall not find me lacking."</p>

<p>Then he turned and went with his knights into
the city, while Gawaine was borne from the field
to one of the king's pavilions, where leeches were
brought to attend him.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the king, "that ever this unhappy
war began, for Sir Lancelot ever forbeareth me,
and my kin also, and that is well seen in his sparing
my nephew Gawaine this day."</p>

<p>Then Arthur fell sick from sorrow for the hurt
of his nephew and regret for the war. The siege
was kept up, but with little energy, and both sides
rested from their toils.</p>

<p>Three weeks passed before Gawaine regained his
strength; but as soon as he was able to ride he
armed again, mounted his horse, and rode to the
gate of Benwick, where he loudly repeated his challenge
to Lancelot as a traitor and recreant knight.</p>

<p>"You got the best of me by mischance at our
last battle," he said, "but if you dare come into
the field this day I will make amends, and lay you
as low as you laid me."</p>

<p>"Defend me from such a fate," said Lancelot,
"for if you should get me into such a strait my
days were done. But since you in this unknightly
fashion charge me with treason, I warrant you shall
have both hands full before you gain your end."</p>

<p>Then Lancelot armed and rode out, and the battle
began as before, with a circle of armed knights
surrounding. But in this onset Gawaine's spear
broke into a hundred pieces in his hand, while
Lancelot struck him with such might that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
horse's feet were raised, and horse and rider toppled
to the earth.</p>

<p>"Alight, traitor knight!" cried Gawaine, drawing
his sword. "If a horse has failed me, think
not that a king and queen's son shall fail thee."</p>

<p>Then Lancelot sprang to the ground and the
battle went on as before, Gawaine's strength increasing
hour by hour. But Lancelot, feeling this,
warily kept his strength and his wind, keeping
under cover of his shield, and tracing and traversing
back and forth, to break the strength and courage
of his foe.</p>

<p>As for Gawaine, he put forth all his might and
power to destroy Lancelot, and for three hours
pressed him so fiercely that he could barely defend
himself. But when noon passed, and Lancelot felt
Gawaine's strength again decline, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have proved you twice, Sir Gawaine. By
this magic trick of your strength increasing you
have deceived many a valiant knight. You have
done your worst; now you shall see of what metal
I am made."</p>

<p>Then he attacked him fiercely, and Gawaine
defended himself with all his power; but at length
there fell such a heavy blow on his helmet and on
the old wound, that he sank to the earth in a
swoon. When he came to himself again, he struck
feebly at Lancelot as he lay, and cried spitefully,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou false traitor, I am not yet slain. Come
near me, and do this battle to the uttermost."</p>

<p>"I shall do no more than I have done," said
Lancelot. "When I see you on your feet again I
shall stand ready to fight you to the bitter end.
But to smite a wounded and prostrate man!&mdash;God
defend me from such a shame."</p>

<p>And he turned and went towards the city, while
Gawaine with spiteful malice called him traitor,
and vowed he would never cease to fight with him
till one of them was dead.</p>

<p>A month now passed away, during which Gawaine
lay sick of his wound. As he slowly recovered,
the old battle-hunger for Lancelot's blood
returned to his heart, and he impatiently awaited
the day when he could again take the field. But
before this day arrived, news came from England
that put a sudden end to the war; tidings of such
threatening aspect that King Arthur was forced
to return in all haste to his own realm.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h4>THE STING OF THE VIPER.</h4>


<p>Disastrous, indeed, were the news from England.
King Arthur had made the fatal mistake
of placing a villain and dastard in charge of his
realm, for Mordred had taken advantage of his
absence to turn traitor, and seek to seize the crown
and sceptre of England as his own.</p>

<p>News moved but slowly from over seas in those
days, and Mordred, with treasonable craft, had
letters written as though they came from abroad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
which said that King Arthur had been slain in
battle with Sir Lancelot.</p>

<p>Having spread this lie far and wide, he called
the lords together to London in parliament, and
so managed that they voted him king. Then he
was crowned at Canterbury, and held a feast for
fifteen days, after which he went to Winchester,
where Guenever was, and publicly declared that
he would wed his uncle's widow.</p>

<p>When word of this came to Guenever she grew
heavy at heart, for she hated the traitor to her
soul's depth. But she was in his power, and was
forced to hide her secret hate. She therefore
seemed to consent to his will, and desired permission
to go to London, where she might buy all
things that were necessary for the wedding. She
spoke so fairly that he trusted her, and gave her
leave to make the journey.</p>

<p>But no sooner had she reached London than she
took possession of the Tower, and with all haste
supplied it with provisions and garrisoned it with
men, and so held it as a fortress, many knights
holding with her against the usurper.</p>

<p>Mordred soon learned that he had been beguiled
by the queen, and, moved to fury, he hastened
to London, where he besieged the Tower, assailing
it vigorously with great engines of war. But
Guenever held out stoutly against him, and neither
by fair speech nor foul could he induce her to
trust herself into his hands again.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Tower_Pg_324" id="Tower_Pg_324"></a><img src="images/p324.jpg" width="500" height="296" alt="THE TOWER OF LONDON." title="THE TOWER OF LONDON." />
<span class="caption">THE TOWER OF LONDON.</span>
</div>

<p>There now came to Mordred the bishop of Canterbury,
who said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, what would you do? Would you displease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
God and shame knighthood by wedding the wife
of your uncle, who has been to you as a father?
Cease this vile purpose, I command you, or I shall
curse you with book, and bell, and candle, and
bring upon your head the vengeance of the church."</p>

<p>"Do your worst, sir priest," said Mordred, angrily.
"I defy you."</p>

<p>"I shall do what I ought; be sure of that. You
noise about that the lord Arthur is slain, no word
of which I believe. You seek with a lie to make
mischief in this land. Beware, lest your vile work
recoil upon yourself."</p>

<p>"Peace, thou false priest," cried Mordred.
"Chafe me no more, or I shall order that thy head
be stricken off."</p>

<p>Finding that words were useless, the bishop
departed, and, as he had threatened, laid the curse
of the church on Mordred. Roused to rage by
this, the usurper sought him to slay him, and he
fled in all haste to Glastonbury, where he took
refuge as a hermit in a chapel. But well he knew
that war was at hand, and that the rightful king
would soon strike for the throne.</p>

<p>Despite the anathema of the church, Mordred
continued his efforts to get Guenever into his
power; but she held firmly to the Tower, repelling
all his assaults, and declaring openly that she would
rather kill herself than marry such a wretch. Soon
afterwards he was forced to raise the siege, for word
came to him by secret messengers that Arthur had
heard of his treason, and was coming home with
his whole host to revenge himself on the usurper
of his crown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>When Mordred heard this he made strenuous
efforts to gather a large army, and many lords
joined him with their people, saying that with
Arthur there had been nothing but war and strife,
but that with Mordred they hoped for peace and
a quiet life. Thus was evil said of the good King
Arthur when he was away from the land, and that
by many who owed to him their honors and estates.
Mordred was thus quickly able to draw with
a great host to Dover, where he had heard that
Arthur would land, for he hoped to defeat and slay
him before he could get firm footing on England's
soil.</p>

<p>Not long had he been there when a great fleet
of ships, galleys, and carracks appeared upon the
sea, bearing the king's army back to their native
realm. On the beach stood Mordred's host, drawn
up to prevent the landing of the king's army. As
the boats came to the shore, laden with noble men-of-arms,
a fierce struggle ensued, in which many
a knight was slain, while full many a bold baron
was laid low on both sides. But so courageous
was the king, and so fierce the onset of his knights,
that the opposing host could not hinder the landing
of his army. And when they had gained a
footing on the land, they set on Mordred with such
fury that he and all his host were driven back and
forced to fly, leaving Arthur master of the field.</p>

<p>After the battle, the king ordered that the dead
should be buried and the wounded cared for. Among
the latter Sir Gawaine was found lying in a great
boat, where he had been felled with a deadly wound
in the bitter strife. On hearing this direful news,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
Arthur hastened to him and took him in his arms,
with great show of grief and pain.</p>

<p>"In you and in Lancelot I had my highest joy,"
moaned the king. "Now I have lost you both, and
all my earthly happiness is gone."</p>

<p>"My death is at hand," said Gawaine, "and I
owe it all to my own hate and bitterness for I am
smitten on the old wound that Lancelot gave me,
and feel that I must die. Had he but been with
you this unhappy war would never have begun.
Of all this I am the cause, and have but received
my deserts. Therefore I pray you, dear uncle, let
me have paper, pen, and ink, that I may write to
Sir Lancelot with my own hand."</p>

<p>These were brought him, and Gawaine wrote a
moving and tender letter to Lancelot, blaming
himself severely for his hardness of heart.</p>

<p>In this wise it ran,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Unto Sir Lancelot, flower of all noble knights,
I, Sir Gawaine, son of King Lot of Orkney, and
sister's son unto the noble King Arthur, send
greeting; and also these sad tidings, that on the
tenth day of May I was smitten on the old wound
which you gave me at Benwick, and thus through
this wound have I come to my death. And I
would have all the world know that I, Sir Gawaine,
Knight of the Round Table, have met with
death not through your ill-will, but from my own
seeking; therefore I beseech you to come in all
haste to this realm, to which you have heretofore
done such honor. I earnestly pray you, Sir Lancelot,
for all the love that ever was betwixt us, make
no tarrying, but come over the sea in all haste, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
thou mayest with thy noble knights rescue that
royal king who made thee knight, for he is hard
bested with a false traitor, my own half-brother,
Sir Mordred, who has had himself crowned king,
and would have wedded Queen Guenever had she
not taken refuge in the Tower of London. We
put him to flight on our landing, on the tenth day of
May, but he still holds against us with a great host.
Therefore, I pray you to come, for I am within
two hours of my death; and I beg that you will
visit my tomb, and pray some prayer, more or less,
for my soul."</p>

<p>When Sir Gawaine had finished this letter he
wept bitter tears of sorrow and remorse, and Arthur
wept beside him till they both swooned, the
one from grief, the other from pain. When they
recovered, the king had the rites of the church
administered to the dying knight, who then prayed
him to send in haste for Lancelot, and to cherish
him above all other knights, as his best friend
and ally.</p>

<p>Afterwards, at the hour of noon, Gawaine yielded
up his spirit. And the king had him interred in
Dover castle, where men to this day may see his
skull, with the wound thereon that Lancelot gave
him in battle.</p>

<p>Word was now brought to King Arthur that
Mordred had pitched a new camp on Barham Down.
Thither in all haste he led his army, and there a
second great battle was fought, with much loss on
both sides. But at the end Arthur's party stood
best, and Mordred fled, with all his host, to Canterbury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>This second victory changed the feeling of the
country, and many people who had held aloof
joined the king's army, saying that Mordred was
a traitor and usurper. When the dead had been
buried and the wounded cared for, Arthur marched
with his host to the sea-shore, westward towards
Salisbury. Here a challenge passed between him
and Mordred, in which they agreed to meet on a
down beside Salisbury, on the day after Trinity
Sunday, and there fight out their quarrel.</p>

<p>Mordred now made haste to recruit his army,
raising many men about London, for the people
of that section of the country held largely with
him, and particularly those who were friendly to
Lancelot. When the time fixed came near, the
two armies drew together and camped on Salisbury
Down.</p>

<p>And so the days passed till came the night of
Trinity Sunday, when the king dreamed a strange
dream, for it seemed to him that he sat in a chair
that was fastened to a wheel, and was covered
with the richest cloth of gold that could be made.
But far beneath him he beheld a hideous black
pool, in which were all manner of serpents, and
vile worms, foul and horrible. Suddenly the wheel
seemed to turn, and he fell among the serpents,
which seized upon his limbs.</p>

<p>Awakening in fright, he loudly cried, "Help!"
and knights and squires came crowding in alarm
into his chamber; but he was so amazed that he
knew not where he was nor what he said.</p>

<p>Then he fell again into a half slumber, in which
Gawaine seemed to come to him attended by a
number of fair ladies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>"Fair nephew," asked the king, "who are these
ladies?"</p>

<p>"They are those for whom I did battle during
my life," answered Gawaine. "God has sent them
and me to warn you of your coming death, for if
you fight with Mordred to-morrow as you have
agreed, you will both be slain, and most of your
people. Therefore I am here to warn you not
to fight to-morrow, but to treat with the traitor,
and make him large and fair promises, so as to gain
a month's delay. Within that time Lancelot and
his knights will come, and Mordred the usurper cannot
hold against you both."</p>

<p>This said, Gawaine and the ladies vanished.
Then Arthur waked, and sent messengers in haste
to bring his lords and bishops to council. When
they had come he told them his dream, and they
counselled him by all means to be guided by it.
Lucan the butler, and his brother Sir Bevidere,
with two bishops, were therefore sent to treat with
Mordred, and make him large promises for a month's
truce.</p>

<p>The commissioners sought Mordred's camp and
held a long conference with him. At the end he
agreed to meet King Arthur on the plain between
the hosts, each to bring but fourteen persons with
him, and there consult on the treaty.</p>

<p>"I am glad that this is accomplished," said the
king, when word of the compact was brought him.</p>

<p>But when he was ready to start for the place
of conference, with the fourteen chosen men, he
said to his knights,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be wary and watchful, for I trust not Mordred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
If you see any sword drawn, come fiercely
forward, and slay the villain and his guard."</p>

<p>Mordred gave the same warning to his lords,
for he had equal mistrust of Arthur, whom he
feared and doubted.</p>

<p>The two leaders, with their chosen followers,
now advanced and met between the hosts. But
by a fatal chance, as the king and his opponent
were in consultation, an adder came from a heath
bush and stung a knight on the foot. Feeling the
wound he drew his sword in thoughtless haste to
kill the venomous serpent. But the instant the
hosts on both sides saw that sword flash in the air
all was uproar and tumult. On both sides trumpets
and horns were blown, harness rattled and
clanked, and the flash of spear-heads and sword-blades
gleamed in the sunlight, while like two
mighty waves of war the great hosts broke from
their stations and rushed together across the plain.</p>

<p>Then Arthur sprang to his horse, exclaiming,
"Alas! this unhappy day!" and rode to his party;
and Mordred did likewise.</p>

<p>No hand nor voice could stay the advancing hosts,
and in a moment there began the most doleful battle
ever seen in Christian land. For there was rushing
and riding, foining and striking, and deadly
clamor, and fearful strife. Many a grim word was
there spoken, and many a deadly stroke dealt. Many
times King Arthur rode through Mordred's host,
and knightly were the deeds of his hands. And
Mordred fought with knightly valor and zeal.</p>

<p>Thus went on the deadly fray all day long,
without pause or stint, till noble knights lay like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
fallen leaves upon the bloody ground. And when
nightfall was at hand they still fought with desperate
valor, though by that time full a hundred
thousand men lay dead upon the down.</p>

<p>Then the heart of Arthur grew full of warlike
fury, to see so many of his people slain. And
when the sun was near its setting, he leaned upon
his crimson sword, and looked about him with
eyes that seemed to weep blood. For of all his
mighty host of knights but two remained alive,
Sir Lucan the butler, and his brother Sir Bevidere;
and both of these were sorely wounded.</p>

<p>"God's mercy!" cried the king, "where are all
my noble knights? Alas! that I have lived to see
this doleful day! Now, indeed, am I come to my
end. But would to God I knew where to find that
traitor, Mordred, who has caused all this mischief."</p>

<p>As he spoke, his eyes fell on Mordred, who stood
leaning upon his sword amid a great heap of slain,
for his host had been slaughtered to a man.</p>

<p>"Give me my spear," cried Arthur, wrathfully,
to Sir Lucan. "Yonder stands the traitor who has
wrought this dire woe."</p>

<p>"Let him be," said Lucan. "He is unhappy
enough. Remember, my good lord, your last night's
dream, and what the spirit of Sir Gawaine told
you. For God's sake make an end of this fray.
Blessed be God, we have won the field; for here
are three of us alive, while Mordred stands alone
among his dead. If you leave off now, the wicked
day of destiny will pass and life remain to you.
Your time for revenge will come hereafter."</p>

<p>"Betide me life, betide me death," cried the king,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
"this fray must end here. Now that I see him
yonder alone, he shall never escape my hands.
One or both of us shall die."</p>

<p>"Then God speed the just cause," said Bevidere.</p>

<p>With no word more Arthur took his spear in
both hands, and ran furiously at Mordred, crying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Traitor, now has thy day of death come!"</p>

<p>When Mordred heard him, he raised his dripping
sword and ran to meet the king. Thus they
met in mid-field, and King Arthur smote Mordred
under the shield, the spear piercing his body more
than a fathom.</p>

<p>Mordred felt that he had his death-wound, but
with a last impulse of fury in his felon soul he
thrust himself, with all his strength, up to the bur
of King Arthur's spear. Then wielding his sword
with both hands, he struck the king so dread a blow
on the side of the head that the trenchant blade
cut through the helmet and deep into the skull.</p>

<p>With this last and fatal stroke Mordred fell stark
dead to the ground. And Arthur sank in a swoon
to the earth, where he lay like one dead.</p>

<p>Thus sadly and direfully ended that dreadful
war, with which came to a close the flower of the
days of chivalry, and the glorious and never-to-be
equalled fellowship of the Round Table, with
all the mighty deeds of prowess and marvels of
adventure that to it belonged. For of those noble
knights, except Sir Lancelot and his kindred, only
two lived, Sir Lucan the butler, and Sir Bevidere
his brother, and of these two Sir Lucan was wounded
unto death; and with them the illustrious King
Arthur, whose chivalrous soul had so long sustained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
this noble order of knighthood, lay bleeding piteously
upon that direful field of blood.</p>

<p>Sir Lucan and Bevidere, with bitter tears of sorrow,
lifted their helpless king between them, and
with great labor led him from that place of slaughter
till they reached a small chapel near the sea-shore.
Here, as the night drew on, the sound of
many voices came to them, as if the dead had risen
and were astir on the blood-stained field.</p>

<p>"What noise is this, Sir Lucan?" said the king.
"Go, gentle friend, and tell me what it means."</p>

<p>Lucan went, and by the moonlight saw a throng
of pillagers, who robbed the dead bodies of money
and jewels, killing for their riches those knights
who were not quite dead. When he brought this
news back to Arthur, the king's sad heart came
near to breaking.</p>

<p>"Alas! Lancelot," he said, "how have I missed
you this day. Alas! that I ever turned against
you, for had you been here this fatal end could
never have been, nor those noble warriors left to
be the prey of the wolves and jackals of the battle-field.
Sorely have I erred and sadly have I been
repaid for my error. But now, alas, it is too late
for regret or amendment, for the fellowship of
the Round Table is at an end, and Arthur the king
shall reign no more."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h4>THE PASSING OF ARTHUR.</h4>


<p>When morning dawned, after that day of fate,
Lucan and Bevidere took up the king between
them, and sought to bear him to the sea-shore, as
he bade them do. But in the lifting the king
swooned, and Lucan fell prostrate, the blood gushing
anew from his wound.</p>

<p>Arthur lay long like one dead, and when he
came to himself again he saw Lucan lifeless at
his feet, with foam upon his lips, and the ground
around him deeply stained with his blood.</p>

<p>"Alas! this is a heavy sight to see," he said.
"He sought to help me when he stood most in
need of help. He would not complain though his
heart broke, and has given his life for mine. May
Jesus have mercy on his soul."</p>

<p>Bevidere stood beside him, weeping bitterly for
the death of his brother.</p>

<p>"Weep and mourn no more," said the king. "It
will not now avail. Could I live, the death of Sir
Lucan would grieve me evermore. But my time
goeth fast, and there is that to do for which but
few moments remain."</p>

<p>Then he closed his eyes for a time, like one who
sees visions; and when he looked again there was
that in his face which Bevidere could not fathom
and his eyes were deep with meaning unrevealed.</p>

<p>"Now, my lord Bevidere," said the king, "the
end is at hand. Take thou my good sword Excalibur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
and go with it to yonder water-side. When
thou comest there, I charge thee throw it as far as
thou canst into the water; then come again and
tell me what thing thou seest."</p>

<p>"Trust me, my lord and king, your command
shall be obeyed," said Bevidere.</p>

<p>So he took the sword and departed to the water-side.
But as his eyes fell upon the noble weapon,
whose pommel and haft were all of precious stones,
a feeling of greed came upon him and he said to
himself,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I throw this rich sword into the water, no
good can come of it, but only harm and loss. Had
I not better keep it for myself?"</p>

<p>Moved by this thought, he hid Excalibur under
a tree, and returned to the king, whom he told that
he had thrown the sword into the water.</p>

<p>"What saw you there?" asked the king.</p>

<p>"Sir, I saw nothing but the rippling waves."</p>

<p>"Then you speak untruly," said the king. "You
have not thrown the sword as I bade you. Go again,
and obey my command, as you are to me dear and
true. Spare not, but throw it in afar."</p>

<p>Bevidere thereupon went again, and took the
sword in his hand. But the rich jewels so glittered
in the sun that his greed came back more strongly
than before, and he deemed it a sin to throw into
the sea that noble blade. So he hid the sword again,
and returned to the king with his former tale.</p>

<p>"What sawest thou there?" asked the king.</p>

<p>"Sir, I saw nothing but the waves that broke on
the beach, and heard only the roar of the surf."</p>

<p>"Ah, traitor! false and untrue art thou!" cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
the king. "Thou hast betrayed me twice. Who
would have thought that thou, whom I held dear,
and who art named a noble knight, would betray
his king for the jewels of a sword? Go again, for
thy long delay puts me in a great jeopardy of my
life. If now you do not as I have bidden, beware
of me hereafter, for dead or alive I will have revenge
upon you. Would you, Sir Bevidere, for a
shining blade, bring death and ruin to your king?"</p>

<p>Then Bevidere, heart-full of shame, hastened
away, and took the sword, turning his eyes manfully
away from its jewelled hilt. Binding the
girdle around it, with all the might of his arm he
hurled the blade far out over the waves.</p>

<p>Then came a marvel. For as he followed the
sword with his eyes, he saw a hand and arm rise
above the waves to meet the blade. The hand
caught it by the hilt, and brandished it thrice in
the air, and then vanished with it into the water.</p>

<p>Bevidere, much wondering, hurried back to the
king, and told him what he had seen.</p>

<p>"Now, Sir Bevidere, you have done as I bade
you," said Arthur. "But much precious time have
you lost. Help me hence, in God's name, for I
fear that I have tarried over-long."</p>

<p>Then Bevidere took the king on his back and
bore him to the water-side, and lo! there he saw
another strange thing.</p>

<p>For close by the shore lay a little barge, which
he had not seen before, and in it sat many fair
ladies, among whom were three queens, who wore
black hoods, and wept with bitter sorrow when
they saw King Arthur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>"Now help me into the barge," said the king.</p>

<p>This Sir Bevidere did as gently as he could.
And the three queens received the dying monarch
with deep mourning, and had him laid between
them, with his head on the lap of her who sat in
the centre.</p>

<p>"Alas! dear brother, why have you tarried so
long from me?" said this queen. "Much harm I
fear from this sad wound."</p>

<p>And so they rowed from the land, while Bevidere
stood on the shore sadly watching the barge
go from him.</p>

<p>"Ah, my lord Arthur," he cried, "what shall
become of me, now that you go from me and leave
me here alone among my enemies?"</p>

<p>"Comfort thyself," said the king, "and do what
thou mayest, for in me can no man henceforth
put his trust. I go into the vale of Avilion, to a
happy summer island far over the sea, where I
shall be healed of my grievous wound. But when
I shall come again no voice may tell. Mayhap I
shall never come, but dwell forever in that sunny
vale. If you never hear more of me, pray for my
soul."</p>

<p>Then again the queens and the ladies wept and
moaned, and the barge moved swiftly over the
long waves and afar to sea, while Bevidere stood
and watched it till it became a black speck on the
waters. Then it vanished and was seen no more,
and the lonely watcher cast himself upon the beach,
weeping like one who has lost all life's happiness.</p>

<p>But when night came near he turned and went
wearily away, heavy with the weight of death that
lay upon his soul, for he alone remained of yesterday's
mighty hosts. All that night he journeyed
through a great forest, and in the morning he found
himself between two hoary cliffs, with a chapel and
a hermitage in the glen that lay between.</p>

<p>In this hermitage he found the holy man who
had been archbishop of Canterbury, and who had
come hither to escape Mordred's rage. With him
Bevidere stayed till he was cured of his wounds,
and afterwards he put on poor clothes, and served
the hermit full lowly in fasting and prayers.</p>

<p>But as for the three queens who went with Arthur
to the island of Avilion, the chronicles say that
they were Morgan le Fay his sister, the queen of
Northgalis, and the queen of the Waste Lands.
And with them was Nimue, the lady of the lake.
All were skilled in magic, but whither they bore
King Arthur, or where lies the magical isle of
Avilion, or if he shall come again, all this no man
can say. These are of the secrets that time alone
can tell, and we only know that his coming is not
yet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h4>THE DEATH OF LANCELOT AND GUENEVER.</h4>


<p>When word was brought to Lancelot du Lake
that Mordred had usurped the throne of England,
had besieged Guenever in the Tower of London,
and had sought to prevent Arthur from landing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
at Dover, his soul was moved to wrath and sorrow.
And still more was he moved by the letter
of Sir Gawaine, with its pitiful self-reproach and
earnest wistfulness.</p>

<p>"Is it a time for mourning?" said Sir Bors to
Lancelot. "My counsel is that you cross at once
to England, visit Gawaine's tomb, as he requests,
and then revenge my lord Arthur and my lady
Guenever on this base traitor, Mordred."</p>

<p>"It is well advised," said Lancelot. "To England
we must go in all haste."</p>

<p>Then ships and galleys were made ready with
the greatest despatch, for Lancelot and his host to
pass over to England. And in good time he landed
at Dover, having with him seven kings and a mighty
host of men.</p>

<p>But when he asked the people of Dover the news
of the country, his heart was filled with dismay
to hear of the great battle on Salisbury Downs,
where a hundred thousand men had died in a day,
and of the death of Arthur the king.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said Lancelot, "this is the heaviest
tidings that ever mortal ears heard. Would that
I had been advised in good time. Nothing now
remains to do. I have come too late. Fair sirs,
I pray you to show me the tomb of Sir Gawaine."</p>

<p>Then they brought him into the castle of Dover,
and showed him the tomb. Lancelot fell on his
knees before it, and wept, and prayed heartily for
the soul of him that lay within. And that night
he made a funeral feast, to which all who came had
flesh, fish, wine, and ale, and every man and woman
was given twelve pence. With his own hand he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
dealt them money in a mourning gown; and ever
he wept, and prayed for the soul of Sir Gawaine.</p>

<p>In the morning, all the priests and clerks of the
country round gathered, at his request, and sang
a requiem mass before the tomb. And Lancelot
offered a hundred pounds, and each of the seven
kings forty pounds, and a thousand knights offered
one pound each, this going on from morning till
night. And Lancelot lay two nights on the tomb
in prayer and weeping.</p>

<p>On the third day he called about him the kings,
dukes, earls, barons, and knights of his train, and
said to them,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My fair lords, I thank you all for coming into
this country with me; but we have come too late,
and that I shall mourn while I live. But since it
is so, I shall myself ride and seek my lady Queen
Guenever, for men say that she has fled from London,
and become a nun, and that she lives in deep
penance, and in fasting, prayers, and almsgiving,
and is sick almost unto death. Therefore, I pray
you, await me here, and if I come not again within
fifteen days, then take ship and return to your own
country."</p>

<p>"Is it wise for you to ride in this realm?" said
Sir Bors. "Few friends will you find here now."</p>

<p>"Be that as it may," said Lancelot, "I shall go
on my journey. Keep you still here, for no man
nor child shall go with me."</p>

<p>No boot was it to strive with him, and he departed
and rode westerly, on a seven or eight
days' journey, asking of all people as he went. At
last he came to the nunnery where was Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
Guenever, who saw him as she walked in the cloister,
and swooned away, so that her ladies had work
enough to keep her from falling. When she could
speak, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ye marvel why I am so held. Truly, it is for
the sight of yonder knight. Bid him come hither,
I pray you."</p>

<p>And when Sir Lancelot had come, she said to him
with sweet and sad visage,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir Lancelot, through our love has all this happened,
and through it my noble lord has come to
his death. As for me, I am in a way to get my
soul's health. Therefore, I pray you heartily, for
all the love that ever was between us, that you see
me no more in the visage; but turn to thy kingdom
again, and keep well thy realm from war and wrack.
So well have I loved you that my heart will not
serve me to see you, for through you and me is the
flower of kings and knights destroyed. Therefore,
Sir Lancelot, go to thy realm, and take there a wife,
and live with her in joy and bliss; and I beseech
you heartily to pray to God for me, that I may
amend my mis-living."</p>

<p>"Nay, madam, I shall never take a wife," said
Lancelot. "Never shall I be false to you; but
the same lot you have chosen that shall I choose."</p>

<p>"If you will do so, I pray that you may," said
the queen. "Yet I cannot believe but that you will
turn to the world again."</p>

<p>"Madam," he earnestly replied, "in the quest of
the Sangreal I would have forsaken the world but
for the service of your lord. If I had done so
then with all my heart, I had passed all the knights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
on the quest except Galahad, my son. And had
I now found you disposed to earthly joys, I would
have begged you to come into my realm. But since
I find you turned to heavenly hopes, I, too, shall
take to penance, and pray while my life lasts, if I
can find any hermit, either gray or white, who will
receive me. Wherefore, madam, I pray you kiss
me, and never more shall my lips touch woman's."</p>

<p>"Nay," said the queen, "that shall I never do.
But take you my blessing, and leave me."</p>

<p>Then they parted. But hard of heart would he
have been who had not wept to see their grief; for
there was lamentation as deep as though they had
been wounded with spears. The ladies bore the
queen to her chamber, and Lancelot took his horse
and rode all that day and all that night in a forest,
weeping.</p>

<p>At last he became aware of a hermitage and a
chapel that stood between two cliffs, and then he
heard a little bell ring to mass, so he rode thither
and alighted, and heard mass.</p>

<p>He that sang mass was the archbishop of Canterbury,
and with him was Sir Bevidere. After the
mass they conversed together, and when Bevidere
had told all his lamentable tale, Lancelot's heart
almost broke with sorrow. He flung his arms
abroad, crying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alas! who may trust this world?"</p>

<p>Then he kneeled, and prayed the bishop to shrive
and absolve him, beseeching that he might accept
him as his brother in the faith. To this the bishop
gladly consented, and he put a religious habit on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
Lancelot, who served God there night and day with
prayers and fastings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the army remained at Dover. But
Lionel with fifteen lords rode to London to seek
Lancelot. There he was assailed by Mordred's
friends, and slain with many of his lords. Then
Sir Bors bade the kings, with their followers, to
return to France. But he, with others of Lancelot's
kindred, set out to ride over all England in
search of their lost leader.</p>

<p>At length Bors came by chance to the chapel
where Lancelot was. As he rode by he heard the
sound of a little bell that rang to mass, and thereupon
alighted and entered the chapel. But when
he saw Lancelot and Bevidere in hermits' clothing
his surprise was great, and he prayed for the privilege
to put on the same suit. Afterwards other
knights joined them, so that there were seven in all.</p>

<p>There they remained in penance for six years,
and afterwards Sir Lancelot took the habit of a
priest, and for a twelvemonth he sang mass. But
at length came a night when he had a vision that
bade him to seek Almesbury, where he would find
Guenever dead. Thrice that night was the vision
repeated, and Lancelot rose before day and told
the hermit of what he had dreamed.</p>

<p>"It is from God," said the hermit. "See that
you make ready, and disobey not the warning."</p>

<p>So, in the early morn, Lancelot and his fellows
set out on foot from Glastonbury to Almesbury,
which is little more than thirty miles. But they
were two days on the road, for they were weak
and feeble with long penance. And when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
reached the nunnery they found that Guenever
had died but half an hour before.</p>

<p>The ladies told Lancelot that the queen had
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hither cometh Lancelot as fast as he may to
fetch my corpse. But I beseech Almighty God
that I may never behold him again with my mortal
eyes."</p>

<p>This, said the ladies, was her prayer for two days,
till she died. When Lancelot looked upon her dead
face he wept not greatly, but sighed. And he said
all the service for the dead himself, and in the
morning he sang mass.</p>

<p>Then was the corpse placed in a horse-bier, and
so taken to Glastonbury with a hundred torches
ever burning about it, and Lancelot and his fellows
on foot beside it, singing and reading many a holy
orison, and burning frankincense about the corpse.</p>

<p>When the chapel had been reached, and services
said by the hermit archbishop, the queen's corpse
was wrapped in cered cloth of Raines, thirty-fold,
and afterwards was put in a web of lead, and then
in a coffin of marble.</p>

<p>But when the corpse of her whom he had so
long loved was put in the earth, Lancelot swooned
with grief, and lay long like one dead, till the
hermit came and aroused him, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are to blame for such unmeasured grief.
You displease God thereby."</p>

<span class="caption2">Copyright by F. Frith and Co. Ltd., London, England.<br /></span>
<span class="caption">THE OLD KITCHEN OF GLASTONBURY ABBEY.</span>
</div>

<p>"I trust not," Lancelot replied, "for my sorrow
is too deep ever to cease. When I remember how
greatly I am to blame for the death of this noble
King Arthur and Queen Guenever, my heart sinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
within me, and I feel that I shall never know a
moment's joy again."</p>

<p>Thereafter he sickened and pined away, for the
bishop nor any of his fellows could make him eat
nor drink but very little, but day and night he
prayed, and wasted away, and ever lay grovelling
on the tomb of the queen.</p>

<p>So, within six weeks afterwards, Lancelot fell
sick and lay in his bed. Then he sent for the bishop
and all his fellows, and said with sad voice: "Sir
Bishop, I pray you give me all the rites that belong
to a Christian man, for my end is at hand."</p>

<p>"This is but heaviness of your blood," replied
the bishop. "You shall be well amended, I hope,
through God's grace, by to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"In heaven, mayhap, but not on earth," said
Lancelot. "So give me the rites of the church,
and after my death, I beg you to take my body
to Joyous Gard, for there I have vowed that I would
be buried."</p>

<p>When they had heard this, and saw that he was
indeed near his end, there was such weeping and
wringing of hands among his fellows that they could
hardly help the bishop in the holy offices of the
church. But that night, after the midnight hour,
as the bishop lay asleep, he fell into such a hearty
laugh of joy that they all came to him in haste,
and asked him what ailed him.</p>

<p>"Why did you wake me?" he cried. "I was
never in my life so happy and merry."</p>

<p>"Wherefore?" asked Sir Bors.</p>

<p>"Truly, here was Sir Lancelot with me, with
more angels than I ever saw men together; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
I saw the angels bear him to heaven, and the gates
of heaven opened to him."</p>

<p>"This is but the vexation of a dream," said Sir
Bors. "Lancelot may yet mend."</p>

<p>"Go to his bed," said the hermit, "and you shall
find if my dream has meaning."</p>

<p>This they hastened to do, and there lay Lancelot
dead, but with a smile on his lips, and the
sweetest savor about him they ever had known.</p>

<p>Great was the grief that followed, for never
earthly man was mourned as was Lancelot. In the
morning, after the bishop had made a requiem
mass, he and his fellows put the corpse of the noble
knight into the same horse-bier that had borne
Guenever, and the queen's corpse with it, and they
were taken together to Joyous Gard, with such state
and ceremony as befitted those of royal blood.</p>

<p>And there all the services of the church were
sung and read, while the face of Lancelot lay open
for people to see; for such was then the custom of
the land. When the services were over they were
buried in one tomb, for so great had been their love
during life that all men said they should not be
divided in death.</p>

<p>During these events, Sir Constantine, the noble
son of Sir Cador of Cornwall, had been chosen king
of England in Arthur's place, and a worthy monarch
he proved, ruling the realm worshipfully and long.</p>

<p>After Lancelot's death the new king sent for
the bishop of Canterbury, and restored him to his
archbishopric; but Sir Bevidere remained a hermit
at Glastonbury to his life's end.</p>

<p>King Constantine also desired the kindred of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
Lancelot to remain in his realm; but this they
would not do, but returned to their own country.
Four of them, Sir Bors, Sir Hector, Sir Blamor,
and Sir Bleoberis, went to the Holy Land, where
they fought long and stoutly against the Saracens.
And there they died upon a Good Friday, for God's
sake.</p>

<p>And so ends the book of the life and death of
King Arthur and his noble Knights of the Round
Table, who were an hundred and fifty when they
were all together. Let us pray that God was merciful
to them all.</p>

<p>THE END.</p>
